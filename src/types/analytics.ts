/**
 * Shared analytics DTOs.
 *
 * Pre-v1.4.41, three structurally-distinct `interface AnalyticsData {…}`
 * declarations lived inline in `src/app/page.tsx` (dashboard), in
 * `src/app/insights/page.tsx` (insights-mother), and in
 * `src/components/onboarding/getting-started-checklist.tsx` (checklist).
 * The names collided across files even though the shapes did not, which
 * made "where does the analytics payload live?" un-discoverable.
 *
 * v1.4.41 W-ORG (org-audit rec #2) hoists every shape into this module
 * under a name that says which surface it describes. The header below
 * documents the relationships so a future contract change has one
 * place to land.
 *
 *   - `SubPageAnalyticsData` — slim shape consumed by every
 *     `/insights/<metric>/page.tsx`; just `summaries`.
 *   - `DashboardAnalyticsData` — dashboard root (`src/app/page.tsx`);
 *     carries the `bpInTargetPct*` aggregates the sub-pages don't use
 *     plus `glucoseByContext` and `lastSeenByType`.
 *   - `InsightsAnalyticsData` — insights mother page
 *     (`src/app/insights/page.tsx`); carries `correlations` +
 *     `healthScore` blocks that the sub-pages also don't use.
 *     ultra-loose shape that only checks per-type `count` for
 *     "do you have any data of this kind yet?".
 *
 * NOTE: we keep four shapes (rather than collapsing into one with
 * everything optional) because the call-sites use TypeScript control
 * flow to *demand* the fields they need — the slim sub-pages should
 * not be able to type-pass an access to `bpInTargetPct`, the checklist
 * should not be able to read `correlations`, and the dashboard should
 * not be reading `healthScore` without going through the insights
 * surface. Three named shapes capture the contract; one swiss-army
 * shape loses it.
