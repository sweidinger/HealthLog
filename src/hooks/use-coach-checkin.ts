/**
 * S3 — the coach check-in card's keep / let-go actions (§2.3).
 *
 * The Today rail surfaces a `coach_checkin` `PriorityItem` whose two mutating
 * one-tap actions close the coach loop through the EXISTING plan-lifecycle
 * route (`PATCH /api/coach/plans/[id]`) — no new backend surface:
 *   - keep  → re-arm: status `active` + `reviewDate` pushed out one more cycle,
 *             so the check-in comes back in a week rather than the same day;
 *   - letGo → guilt-free retirement: status `abandoned`, a terminal, respected
 *             outcome (the calm inversion of a streak). The card never nags.
 *
 * "Adjust" is navigation (an `href` into the coach) handled by `PriorityCard`
 * as a `<Link>` — it never reaches this hook.
 *
 * Both invalidate the daily digest (so the acted-on card leaves the rail) and
 * every plans-list slot (so the /coach/plans ledger stays in step). Keys route
 * through the centralised factory — no bare arrays.
