/**
 * v1.12.8 — chart-reactive metric statistics.
 *
 * A metric sub-page lifts this hook so its `<HealthChart>` and its
 * `<MetricStatStrip>` read the same window. The chart reports the per-type
 * Min / Max / Median / Mean for the data currently visible under its active
 * range tab (the 7 / 30 / 90 / All selector) through `onVisibleStats`; the
 * strip reads `statsByType[type]` and renders those windowed numbers.
 *
 * `null` (no data, or mini mode) means "show the full range" — the strip
 * falls back to the precomputed summary. The chart owns the maths (it already
 * holds the bucketed series), so the hook only stores what it is handed and
 * exposes a stable callback.
 *
 * The callback is referentially stable across renders so it can sit in the
 * chart's effect dependency list without re-firing. A shallow guard skips the
 * state write when the chart reports the same window twice in a row, keeping a
 * re-render that recomputes the same slice from thrashing the strip.
