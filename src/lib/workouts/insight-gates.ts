/**
 * The pure half of the Activity Insight gate stack.
 *
 * Five gates stand between a workout landing and a provider call, and they run
 * in this order for a reason — each one is cheaper than the one after it, so
 * the common refusals cost nothing:
 *
 *   1. modules  — `workouts` AND `insights` both on (one cached map lookup)
 *   2. duration — at least `MIN_DURATION_SEC` (a field already in hand)
 *   3. daily cap — at most `MAX_INSIGHTS_PER_DAY` generated today (one COUNT)
 *   4. input hash — the evidence is unchanged since the last paragraph (one
 *      indexed read, no provider resolution)
 *   5. budget — the token ledger's reserve/reconcile, inside
 *      `runStatusCompletion`
 *
 * Gates 2 and 4 are pure and live here so each can be tested on its own. The
 * other three need the database and live in the worker beside their query.
 *
 * Every one of them is a SEPARATE claim. The daily cap does not depend on the
 * hash holding, and the hash does not depend on the singleton queue key
 * holding: a device that double-posts the same session must be stopped by the
 * unique row and by the hash independently, because a queue key is a
 * best-effort de-duplication and a lost singleton race is a normal event.
