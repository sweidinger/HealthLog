/**
 * v1.4.42 W5 — write-time cross-source canonical-row picker for
 * incoming `Workout` ingest payloads.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside the read-time helper
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two related-but-distinct dedup paths exist in the codebase:
 *
 *   - `pickCanonicalWorkoutRows()` in `src/lib/measurements/` (v1.4.30)
 *     — READ-time picker invoked by `GET /api/workouts` /
 *     `GET /api/workouts/[id]`. It walks DB rows, looks up the user's
 *     persisted `sourcePriorityJson`, buckets by 5-minute slot, and
 *     filters the read result so the dashboard tile shows one row per
 *     logical workout.
 *
 *   - This helper (`dedupeWorkoutBatch`, v1.4.42) — WRITE-time picker
 *     invoked by `POST /api/workouts/batch` BEFORE
 *     `prisma.workout.createMany`. The name intentionally diverges
 *     from the read-time picker to make the auto-completion path
 *     unambiguous (write-time payload-internal dedup vs. read-time
 *     cross-batch dedup with user-priority resolution).
 *     The v1.5 iOS sprint will ingest `HKWorkoutType` data in batches
 *     against `/api/workouts/batch`; Apple Watch + Withings ScanWatch
 *     paired to the same iPhone frequently capture the same workout
 *     simultaneously (e.g. a Sunday-morning run) and the iOS app may
 *     post both rows in one batch. Without write-time dedup, both
 *     rows would persist (their `externalId`s differ, so the
 *     `(userId, source, externalId)` unique index doesn't fire) and
 *     the read-time picker would carry the duplicate forward at every
 *     downstream read.
 *
 * The two pickers are layered, not redundant:
 *   - Write-time picker drops PAYLOAD-internal duplicates inside a
 *     single batch so we don't pay the storage cost.
 *   - Read-time picker still runs to collapse cross-batch duplicates
 *     (e.g. Apple Watch row from Monday's batch + ScanWatch row from
 *     Tuesday's backfill batch).
 *
 * Algorithm
 * ─────────
 *
 *   1. Group by `(userId, activityType, startedAt ± 90 s window)`.
 *      The 90-second window is tighter than the read-time picker's
 *      5-minute slot because a single batch from one iOS client has
 *      no cross-device clock skew to absorb — both rows are stamped
 *      with HealthKit's `startDate`, which Apple aggregates to the
 *      same instant across paired sensors. A 90-second cushion
 *      covers HK's documented ±60s smoothing plus a small buffer.
 *   2. Within each group, prefer in order:
 *      `APPLE_HEALTH ≻ WITHINGS ≻ MANUAL ≻ IMPORT`. The literal
 *      source ladder is sourced from `DEFAULT_WORKOUT_SOURCE_PRIORITY`
 *      in `src/lib/sources/pick-canonical-workout.ts` (the v1.4.25
 *      W16a scaffolding) so both pickers consult a single source of
 *      truth — adding a new source enum value is a one-place change.
 *      Per the scope memo the legacy `STRAVA_IMPORT` reference maps
 *      to the actual `IMPORT` enum value (the codebase has no
 *      separate Strava source today; Strava XML imports ride the
 *      generic `IMPORT` bucket).
 *   3. Tie-breaker: higher `caloriesKcal` (more sensor data — a row
 *      with HR-derived calories beats a row with a zero / null
 *      total). Then earliest `createdAt` so re-running the picker
 *      with the same inputs picks the same survivor every time.
 *
 * Purity contract
 * ───────────────
 *
 * Zero Prisma imports, zero IO, zero user lookups. The helper takes
 * an array, returns an array. Testable in isolation; safely invoked
 * from a hot ingest path with no DB round-trip cost.
 *
 * Source-priority parity with the read-time picker
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * CLOSED in v1.4.43 (W9-WORKOUTS-PRIORITY). The read-time picker
 * resolves the per-user `sourcePriorityJson` (from
 * `User.sourcePriorityJson`) for every read so a user who promoted
 * MANUAL above APPLE_HEALTH in Settings → Sources sees their Manual
 * rows surface above the Apple Watch ones. This helper now mirrors
 * that contract — the optional `userPriorityJson` argument feeds
 * through `parseSourcePriority()` + `getSourceLadder(..., "steps")`,
 * the same chain the read-time picker walks, so a customised user
 * keeps their preferred source at BOTH write- and read-time.
 *
 * When the argument is omitted (or null/undefined) the helper falls
 * back to the canonical `DEFAULT_WORKOUT_SOURCE_PRIORITY` ladder so
 * callers that don't yet have the user blob handy stay on the
 * v1.4.42 behaviour. The batch route at
 * `src/app/api/workouts/batch/route.ts` does one indexed
 * `User.sourcePriorityJson` lookup at the start of the handler and
 * passes the blob through here; the cost is a single `findUnique`
 * per batch, well under the cost of letting a customised user's
 * preferred row drop at write-time.

/**
 * Minimum row shape consulted by the picker. Field names mirror the
 * batch-route's prepared `Prisma.WorkoutCreateManyInput` plus a
 * `createdAt` slot for the deterministic tie-breaker. Anything else
 * the caller carried alongside the row (route geometry, HR series,
 * metadata) survives untouched — the picker filters but never
 * mutates and is generic in `T` so call sites keep their own
 * carrier type.
 *
 * Naming aligned with the v1.5 iOS contract:
 *   - `activityType` — the sport type (`"running"`, `"cycling"`,
 *     ...). Matches `Workout.sportType` at the DB layer and
 *     `WorkoutSportType` at the validator layer; cross-source
 *     overlap requires identical sport so a "Walking" + "Running"
 *     pair at the same instant stays as two distinct rows.
 *   - `caloriesKcal` — the active-energy aggregate. The v1.5 iOS
 *     contract uses `caloriesKcal` for parity with HealthKit's
 *     `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierActiveEnergyBurned`; the server's
 *     write path maps it to `Workout.totalEnergyKcal`.
 *   - `createdAt` — when the row was minted. The batch path doesn't
 *     have this yet (it's set by Prisma's `@default(now())` at
 *     insert), so the helper falls back to insertion order via the
 *     `index` field when `createdAt` is undefined on every member.
