/**
 * v1.4.22 W5 reconcile (Sr-H2) — shared `ReadableStream` constructor
 * for Server-Sent-Events handlers.
 *
 * The Coach chat route used to construct three separate
 * `new ReadableStream({ start(controller) { try { … } finally {
 * controller.close(); } } })` blocks — one for the refusal path, one
 * for the provider-error path, one for the happy path. Each emitted a
 * different mix of frames but the construction shape was identical.
 *
 * Extract the boilerplate so future SSE consumers (the v1.5 iOS
 * daily-briefing live-regenerate endpoint is the next one) inherit the
 * same try/finally close semantics without copy-paste.
 *
 * The `emit` callback receives the controller and is awaited inside
 * the `start` body. Any error inside the callback re-enters the
 * `finally` and closes the stream cleanly so the client sees the
 * connection terminate (and never sees a hung response).
