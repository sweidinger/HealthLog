/**
 * v1.4.49 — sensitive-field redactor for observability payloads.
 *
 * The v1.4.48 H-iOS-1 / H-iOS-2 work surfaces a 256-char truncated
 * `JSON.stringify` of the request body to the wide-event
 * `meta.received_shape_excerpt`. Today's iOS surface (widget layout +
 * series query) only carries enum / boolean / int fields so a verbatim
 * excerpt is safe, but the pattern is heading for routes that accept
 * tokens (APNs registration, Withings re-auth, API tokens) and bearer
 * credentials. Pre-empt the leak: every body that flows into a
 * wide-event excerpt is first walked through `redactSensitiveFields`,
 * which replaces any key matching one of the `SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERNS`
 * regexes with the literal string `"[redacted]"`.
 *
 * Adding a new sensitive token is a one-line append to
 * `SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERNS`. The match is case-insensitive and runs
 * against the literal key name, so `apnsToken`, `bearerToken`,
 * `APIKey`, `Authorization` and `csrf_state` all redact without
 * extra spellings.
 *
 * The redactor recurses into nested objects + arrays so deeply-nested
 * credentials (e.g. `{ creds: { password: "…" } }`) are caught the
 * same way. Non-object scalar inputs pass through unchanged — the
 * caller's `JSON.stringify` then truncates as before.
