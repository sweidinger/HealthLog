/**
 * v1.30.22 — the fail-closed backstop inside `collectDoctorReportData`.
 *
 * The MCP surfaces now gate before calling, but gating only at call sites is
 * exactly the arrangement that failed: `loadFhirContext` has an internal
 * backstop for the same aggregate and the routes above it still gate, while
 * this function had none and three MCP callers plus a public share link
 * forgot. The backstop makes the door itself refuse, so the next caller
 * cannot reintroduce the leak by omission.
 *
 * It throws rather than returning an envelope because reaching it means a
 * caller is missing its gate — a bug to surface, not a flow to serve. Callers
 * that can degrade gracefully (the MCP resources, the clinician share) gate
 * themselves first and never reach it.
