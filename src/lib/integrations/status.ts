/**
 * Per-(user, integration) sync-status bookkeeping.
 *
 * v1.4.15 Phase B2 introduces three responsibilities for every Withings /
 * moodLog sync attempt:
 *
 *   1. Record success / failure timestamps so Settings → Integrations
 *      can show "last sync 23 minutes ago" instead of guessing from
 *      `lastSyncedAt` (which only updates on success and tells the user
 *      nothing about a 2-day failure streak).
 *   2. Emit one structured `AuditLog` row per failure — successes are
 *      not audited (would be noisy and `lastSuccessAt` already tracks
 *      them).
 *   3. After N consecutive failures (default 3), notify the admin via
 *      Telegram so a token-revoke or upstream outage doesn't silently
 *      strand a user's data. The dispatcher is reused as-is — B3 owns
 *      reliability/retry of the dispatcher; we are only a caller.
 *
 * The state machine is deliberately small:
 *
 *   connected         → happy path. cleared by recordSyncSuccess().
 *   error_transient   → at least one failure since last success. The
 *                       sync entry-point still attempts on the next
 *                       run (network blip, 5xx, etc.).
 *   error_reauth      → refresh-token grant has revoked. `getValidToken`
 *                       / `syncMoodLogEntries` short-circuit until the
 *                       user reconnects. Cleared by markReconnected()
 *                       on the OAuth callback.
 *   disconnected      → user clicked "Disconnect". Set explicitly by
 *                       the disconnect routes; clears any prior error
 *                       state.
 *
 * `state` is stored as a free-form string column (not a Postgres enum)
 * so adding new sentinels in v1.5 doesn't require a migration.
