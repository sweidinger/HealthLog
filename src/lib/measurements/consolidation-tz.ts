/**
 * Leaf timezone day-math + per-sample-row shape shared by the
 * consolidation drains.
 *
 * This module owns the primitives that both `consolidation-base.ts` (the
 * shared `runConsolidation` driver) and `drain-per-sample-cumulative.ts`
 * (the cumulative drain) need. It deliberately imports nothing from
 * either of those — it is a dependency-free leaf so the two can both
 * reach the helpers without forming an import cycle.
 *
 * History: `dayKeyForUserTz`, `canonicalDailyTimestamp`, `localStartOfDay`,
 * `localDayWindow`, the grace constant, and the `PerSampleRow` shape used
 * to live in `drain-per-sample-cumulative.ts`. `consolidation-base.ts`
 * imported them from there while `drain` imported the runner back — a
 * value-level cycle. Bundled for production (Turbopack merges tightly
 * cyclic modules into one body), the eager re-export
 * `const DRAIN_CUMULATIVE_CUTOFF_HOURS = CONSOLIDATION_GRACE_CUTOFF_HOURS`
 * was hoisted ahead of the constant it read, throwing a
 * `ReferenceError: Cannot access '…' before initialization` at worker
 * boot. Hoisting the shared leaf into this module removes the cycle at
 * its root; `drain-per-sample-cumulative.ts` re-exports these names so
 * every existing import site keeps working unchanged.
