/**
 * v1.4.30 — UI-side categorisation overlay for `MeasurementType`.
 *
 * The flat 27-value enum is the correct storage shape (per R-F §4.1)
 * — Postgres enums are cheap; a per-category sub-table would explode
 * the read joins. The overlay below is presentation-only and drives:
 *
 *   - The iOS HealthKit permission picker — grouped by `category` so
 *     the user sees one consent screen per logical area (vitals,
 *     activity, sleep, …) rather than a flat 27-line list. The iOS
 *     side mirrors this map verbatim via the swift-openapi-generator
 *     codegen path (R-E H-8); a new MeasurementType is one change in
 *     this file + the Prisma enum + the Zod validator + this overlay.
 *
 *   - The web Insights nav (post-v1.5) — the sub-page strip stays
 *     curated at 7 pages, but the "All metrics" overview can group
 *     cards by category cheaply from this map.
 *
 *   - The Coach evidence shelf — chip-grouping by category makes the
 *     prose more navigable than a flat list.
 *
 * Locked: see `.planning/research/v15-r-f-apple-health-depth.md` §4.
