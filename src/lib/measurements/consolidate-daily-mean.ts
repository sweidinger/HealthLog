/**
 * v1.7.0 — consolidate high-frequency spot HealthKit metrics into one
 * daily-MEAN row per user per calendar day.
 *
 * Apple Health emits walking-speed, respiratory-rate, and audio-exposure
 * samples at sensor granularity — tens-to-hundreds of `Measurement` rows
 * per day. Unlike the cumulative types (steps, energy, distance), the
 * correct daily reduction for these is the MEAN, not the SUM. This pass
 * collapses the per-sample rows into a single canonical daily row keyed
 * by the locked `stats:<HKIdentifier>:<YYYY-MM-DD>` externalId shape so
 * historical detail reads consistently and storage stays bounded.
 *
 * Scope per `HIGH_FREQUENCY_MEAN_TYPES`:
 *   RESPIRATORY_RATE, AUDIO_EXPOSURE_ENV, AUDIO_EXPOSURE_HEADPHONE,
 *   WALKING_SPEED, WALKING_STEP_LENGTH, WALKING_ASYMMETRY,
 *   WALKING_DOUBLE_SUPPORT, WALKING_STEADINESS, WALKING_HEART_RATE_AVERAGE
 *
 * PULSE is NOT in the set — correlation/scatter analytics read raw PULSE
 * rows. PULSE keeps raw storage; its display stays daily-averaged via
 * the read-path AVG.
 *
 * Per user × type × completed calendar day (anchored to `User.timezone`):
 *   1. SELECT live (`deletedAt IS NULL`) `source = 'APPLE_HEALTH'` rows
 *      for the type whose externalId is NOT the daily-stats shape and
 *      whose `measuredAt` is older than the 36-hour grace cutoff (keeps
 *      today's in-flight watch syncs raw for the live "today" view).
 *   2. Group into per-day buckets in the user's timezone.
 *   3. Compute the MEAN of the per-sample values for the day.
 *   4. UPSERT the canonical daily row keyed by
 *      `stats:<HKIdentifier>:<dateKey>` at local-noon, `value = mean`.
 *      Because mean types are NOT in `CUMULATIVE_HK_TYPES`, the daily
 *      read path averages over the single stats row (count = 1) and
 *      returns it unchanged — no reader change needed.
 *   5. SOFT-DELETE (set `deletedAt`) the per-sample rows — they stay in
 *      the table as an audit/backup trail. Sub-day detail loss is
 *      accepted, matching the legacy-step consolidation choice.
 *
 * Idempotent: the discovery query matches only users still holding live
 * per-sample mean-type rows, so a second run converges to zero work.
 * Within a run, soft-deleted rows are excluded from the scan, and the
 * single minted stats row is excluded by the `NOT externalId LIKE
 * 'stats:%'` predicate so it is never re-folded.
 *
 * Runs on pg-boss (`MEAN_CONSOLIDATION_QUEUE`), not a CLI — the
 * production standalone image strips `tsx`. Modelled on the
 * `step-consolidation` boot-time converging-backfill pattern.
