/**
 * The derived-resting mint must survive its own previous runs.
 *
 * The fold deletes the raw PULSE samples a proxy user's resting figure is
 * derived from, and mints one `RESTING_HEART_RATE` / `COMPUTED` row per folded
 * day to carry that figure forward. The mint is skipped for users who already
 * have NATIVE resting rows, because the read resolver ignores the proxy for
 * them and a derived row would double-count.
 *
 * The probe that answers "does this user have native resting data?" used to
 * match every source — including the `COMPUTED` rows the mint itself had
 * written. So from the second nightly run onward it answered yes for every
 * proxy user, the mint stopped, and the fold kept tombstoning the raw readings
 * anyway: each run destroyed another day of resting history that cannot be
 * recomputed from anything still in the database.
 *
 * These tests fail on that code. The probe mock filters like the database
 * does, so the assertion is on behaviour (does the row get minted) rather than
 * on the shape of the query.
