/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-E). Dense intra-day retention DRAIN-EXEMPTION
 * regression guard.
 *
 * LOAD-BEARING — a regression here is silent and irreversible.
 *
 * The Stress engine reads the intra-day SDNN (and daytime HR) SHAPE across
 * the day, not a single daily mean. The destructive daily-mean drain
 * (`consolidateDailyMean`) collapses a day's per-sample rows for every type
 * in its allowlist (`HIGH_FREQUENCY_MEAN_TYPES`) to ONE daily mean and
 * SOFT-DELETES the raw rows. If `HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY` (or the daytime
 * `PULSE` the engine relies on) were ever added to that allowlist, the
 * intra-day shape Stress needs would be destroyed the next night the drain
 * ran — and the raw rows would be gone for good.
 *
 * This test pins both exclusions so a future edit that adds either type to
 * the drain's allowlist fails CI loudly. The dense intra-day retention tier
 * (`dense-intraday-retention.ts`) is the ONLY pass allowed to fold these
 * types, and it does so behind a bounded window that preserves the recent
 * intra-day samples.
