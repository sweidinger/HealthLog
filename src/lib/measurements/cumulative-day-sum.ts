/**
 * v1.4.36 W4c — Pure day-bucket sum picker for cumulative metrics.
 *
 * SLEEP_DURATION already runs this shape inline in
 * `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts` lines 198-225: pick a single
 * source per day (source-priority + device-type) then sum the
 * day's slices into one datapoint per day. The dashboard tile
 * surfaces the resulting `latest` as "X minutes asleep".
 *
 * Steps / active energy / walking distance / flights climbed /
 * time-in-daylight share the same physical shape — every iOS
 * HealthKit ingest writes minute-level slices that the dashboard
 * tile was rendering as the *latest slice* instead of the *day's
 * total*. The maintainer reported "Steps tile shows last-measurement-not-day-sum".
 *
 * This helper extracts the per-day-sum reduction so the route can
 * call it for every cumulative metric without copy-pasting the
 * SLEEP_DURATION branch. The source-priority pick stays in the
 * caller (it already imports `pickCanonicalSourceRows`); this
 * helper only handles the bucket-and-sum once that picker has
 * narrowed each day to its canonical source.

 * The set lives in `apple-health-mapping.ts` as `CUMULATIVE_HK_TYPES`
 * (used by the measurements route + nightly drain + chart). This
 * array is the same membership in stable alphabetical order so
 * downstream consumers (analytics route, exports) can iterate
 * deterministically. The W10 reconcile pass collapses the previously
 * duplicated literal to a single derivation so adding a sixth type
 * in `apple-health-mapping.ts` automatically flows through every
 * cumulative-day-sum consumer.
 *
 * Note: SLEEP_DURATION is also cumulative but the route handles
 * it inline because the picker is the canonical sleep source ladder
 * ("sleep" metricKey vs "default"). Once Apple-Health passthrough
 * lands and the sleep ladder needs the same shared treatment it can
 * fold into `CUMULATIVE_HK_TYPES`.
