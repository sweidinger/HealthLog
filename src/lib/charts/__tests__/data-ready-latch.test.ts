/**
 * v1.20.1 — regression cover for the dashboard chart-row render loop.
 *
 * A user reported the dashboard crashing (blank error card) on returning
 * to a backgrounded tab. The snapshot query refetches on window focus,
 * re-rendering the page; every chart was handed an inline
 * `() => markChartReady(id)` closure, so the chart's `onDataReady` notify
 * effect — keyed on that ever-changing prop — re-fired on every commit.
 * That per-commit passive effect kept the tile strip's Radix-Popper
 * anchors re-committing until React tripped its update-depth guard
 * (minified React error #185).
 *
 * The fix latches the notify behind a ref so it fires exactly once on the
 * first non-loading commit and depends on `isLoading` alone. This pins the
 * pure decision and the charts' wiring so the latch cannot silently revert
 * to the per-render notify.
