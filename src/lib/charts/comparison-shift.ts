/**
 * v1.4.16 phase B8 — comparison overlay helper.
 *
 * The dashboard charts already fetch every measurement for the active
 * type set (paged through `/api/measurements`). When the comparison
 * toggle is active we re-use the SAME daily aggregates and shift them
 * forward by 30 days (lastMonth) or 365 days (lastYear) so the prior
 * period lines up with the current period on the visible x-axis.
 *
 * The shift is integer-day exact because the dashboard's daily bucket
 * keys live at UTC noon of each Berlin calendar day — adding or
 * subtracting 30 / 365 days at noon does NOT cross a DST boundary
 * (only 02:00-03:00 wall-clock crossings can flip the calendar day).
 *
 * Pure & deterministic: the helper takes the already-bucketed
 * `[timestamp, value]` rows the chart computes, and emits a parallel
 * series with timestamps shifted forward and values intact. The chart
 * then merges the two series by visible-day so a single Recharts
 * tooltip can render both at once.

 * the resulting overlay row at Feb 14 — directly under the current Feb
 * 14 reading where the user expects to see the comparison.
