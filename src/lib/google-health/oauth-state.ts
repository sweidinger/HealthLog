 * cleanup cron all read these constants so the contract has one source of truth
 * and the unit tests can pin it without importing either route file.
 *
 * The string keys are deliberately distinct from the classic Fitbit provider's
 * (`fitbit_state`) so the two coexisting integrations never collide on a cookie.
