/**
 * Doc ↔ code parity guard for the Google Health operator runbook.
 *
 * The setup-guide link on the Settings card sends a mid-setup user to
 * `docs.healthlog.dev/integrations/google-health`, rendered from
 * `docs/integrations/google-health.md`. If the client ever requests a scope the
 * runbook doesn't list, or the walkthrough regresses back to a wrong provider
 * (the file was once a Fitbit-Web-API walkthrough), a self-hoster follows a
 * broken recipe and the OAuth consent screen rejects the connection.
 *
 * This test pins the doc to the code: every core scope the client requests must
 * appear verbatim in the runbook, alongside the real Google OAuth endpoints, the
 * fixed callback path, and the Google Cloud console setup. It also asserts the
 * provider key is wired into the setup-guide link so the card actually points
 * here.
