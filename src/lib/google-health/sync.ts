/**
 * Google Health sync service (v1.27.0).
 *
 * Token-management + per-resource orchestration:
 *   - `getValidToken` decrypts the stored token, refreshes at
 *     `tokenExpiresAt - 5 min`, persists the new access token + expiry, and —
 *     following Google's semantics — only overwrites the stored refresh token
 *     when the response carries a fresh one (Google does NOT rotate refresh
 *     tokens). A revoked / expired refresh token (the 7-day "Testing"-mode
 *     expiry, or a user-revoked grant) surfaces `invalid_grant`/401 →
 *     `reauth_required`, which parks the connection at `error_reauth` so the
 *     card prompts a reconnect.
 *   - `recordGoogleHealthSyncFailure` / `classificationToFailureKind` map a
 *     classified API error onto the shared integration-status ledger.
 *   - `syncUserGoogleHealth` drives the hourly poll, the manual trigger, and the
 *     boot-time backfill across every resource.
