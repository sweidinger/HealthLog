/**
 * Google Health sleep-bundle sync (v1.27.0).
 *
 * Reads sleep sessions from the `sleep.readonly` Restricted bundle and maps each
 * into per-SEGMENT `SLEEP_DURATION` rows via `mapSleepSession` (one row per stage
 * segment; `measuredAt = that segment's END` instant; harmonised onto the shared
 * `SleepStage` enum IN_BED/AWAKE/ASLEEP/REM/CORE/DEEP that the night-total +
 * hypnogram readers already consume for WHOOP / Apple). Google carries a real
 * per-segment series, so the rows lay each block at its true clock time (a
 * MEASURED timeline, not reconstructed). Upserts as `source = GOOGLE_HEALTH`.
 *
 * Each segment carries the `sleepStage` axis and a fieldTag keyed on the STABLE
 * session anchor plus the segment's own start —
 * `<session-anchor>:sleep:<segment-start>` — so a re-scored night overwrites in
 * place instead of minting parallel duplicate rows the night-total would then
 * double-count. A 24 h overlap covers Google's after-the-fact re-score, and
 * `replaceStaleGoogleHealthSleep` clears anything an earlier scoring left in the
 * night's window before the fresh set upserts.
 *
 * A per-data-class 403 soft-skips the resource — the sleep bundle is granted
 * independently of activity / metrics in the Google consent flow.
