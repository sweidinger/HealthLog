/**
 * MCP auth context.
 *
 * Resolves a pasted `hlk_<hex>` Bearer token to a session-narrowed identity for
 * the MCP transports. Authentication is delegated to the canonical
 * `resolveBearerToken` (`@/lib/auth/bearer`) — the SAME validation the HTTP edge
 * runs — so revoked / expired / scope semantics are identical across both wires
 * (REQ-T1, REQ-SEC-5).
 *
 * Security properties:
 *   - The id is narrowed to one `userId`; tools and resources feed it straight
 *     into the Prisma `where`, never accepting a caller-supplied user id.
 *   - The session is bound to `<user_id>:<token_id>` (REQ-SEC-11), never to a
 *     cookie session — the MCP wire carries no cookie.
 *   - Admin is unreachable by construction: `requireAdmin()` is cookie-only and
 *     this path never mints a cookie session, so no MCP context can elevate
 *     (REQ-SEC-7 / ADR-005). The guard test pins it.
