/**
 * Phase 4 — deep-value MCP read tools (engine glue).
 *
 * Four "bring data into relation" reads, each a THIN re-export of an existing
 * server-authoritative engine — no new statistics, no new business logic
 * (REQ-WONT-2 / catalogue §5):
 *
 *   1. get_correlation     — one named driver pair out of the FDR-controlled,
 *                            lag-aware discovery (`readCoachCorrelations`, the
 *                            same engine the Coach `get_correlations` tool and
 *                            the `/api/insights/correlations` route run).
 *   2. compare_metric      — two trailing-window or two-metric rollup snapshots
 *                            side by side (`readBestGranularityRollups` +
 *                            `aggregateWmyBuckets`) with structured deltas.
 *   3. get_metric_baseline — the metric's personal usual range (median ± k·MAD)
 *                            + today's placement, via `buildCoachReadStrip`
 *                            (the same engine the metric-page "Coach read" strip
 *                            renders).
 *   4. detect_changepoints — level shifts in a metric over the rollup tier, via
 *                            a minimal in-repo CUSUM binary-segmentation over the
 *                            rollup bucket means (no heavy dependency, high
 *                            firing bar).
 *
 * Grounding contract (REQ-SEC-2/3/4, ADR-004): every read returns structured
 * values + units + reference bands + provenance and uses `{ present: false }`
 * for absence / insufficiency — never a silent zero, never a prose verdict or
 * diagnosis. Associations are described, never asserted as causal. `userId` is
 * the session-narrowed id passed by the caller, never a tool argument
 * (REQ-SEC-5). All reads are read-only.
