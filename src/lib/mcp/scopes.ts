 * MCP scope model.
 *
 * The MCP wire reuses the existing `hlk_<hex>` Bearer tokens as its auth
 * substrate (no parallel identity system). Two scope handles frame the
 * least-privilege contract:
 *
 *   - `health:read`  — read the user's own health data. The default MCP posture.
 *   - `health:write` — mutate (log a measurement / intake / mood). Required by
 *     the write tools, which ARE registered and live (see `write-tools.ts`).
 *
 * Read tools impose no scope requirement of their own: every underlying read
 * path is already an unscoped authenticated route, so a narrow-scope token works
 * and a wildcard token is never required (REQ-SEC-5). The "read-only by default"
 * posture (REQ-SEC-1 / ADR-003) is preserved by the scope gate, not by omitting
 * the write surface: write tools are registered but only reachable when the
 * presented token carries `health:write` (or the wildcard), enforced through
 * `tokenAllowsWrite` — a token without it sees the read surface alone.
