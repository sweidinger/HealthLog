/**
 * v1.16.1 — care-routine metrics for the achievement route.
 *
 * Pure helpers over typed rows (no prisma import) so the unit tests can
 * drive synthetic data, mirroring `expansion-metrics.ts`. Two metrics
 * live here:
 *
 *   - `missFreeDayStreak` — consecutive Berlin-local days on which every
 *     resolved dose landed without an auto-miss. A day qualifies when it
 *     carries at least one RESOLVED slot (taken or deliberately skipped)
 *     and zero `autoMissed` rows; a day whose slots are all still
 *     pending is not counted yet (today, typically) but simply stays out
 *     of the series — the historical streak up to yesterday is what the
 *     badge measures. Deliberate skips do not break the run: the
 *     compliance engine treats them as a planned break, and "no missed
 *     dose" is about forgetting, not pausing. Calendar-gap semantics
 *     match the existing day-streak badges (a weekly-only cadence will
 *     not build this streak — same trade-off `onTimePerfectDayStreak`
 *     makes).
 *
 *   - `measurementConsistencyWeeks` — longest run of consecutive
 *     ISO-style (Monday-anchored) weeks each carrying at least
 *     `minDaysPerWeek` distinct active measurement days. Rewards the
 *     boring, clinically useful habit of measuring most days of the
 *     week, week after week, without demanding a perfect daily streak.
