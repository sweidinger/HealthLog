/**
 * v1.30.22 — structural guard on the module→data ownership table.
 *
 * The three MCP leaks all had one root cause: the layer assumed every read
 * inherits gating from `buildCoachSnapshot`, which is true for the
 * Coach-routed tools and false for the families that deliberately bypass it.
 * Fixing the three call sites alone would leave the assumption in place, so
 * the ownership map moved to a shared table and the rich reads gate off it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST FREEZES
 *
 *   1. Every metric the rich reads can resolve has been LOOKED AT: it either
 *      has an owning module or is named in `UNSCOPED_REVIEWED_TYPES`. A new
 *      metric that lands in the resolver without either fails here, which is
 *      the specific way finding 2 was able to happen — metrics became
 *      resolvable over MCP without anyone deciding who owned them.
 *   2. The table stays consistent with the Coach snapshot's own narrowing, so
 *      the MCP wire and the Coach prompt cannot drift into disagreeing about
 *      which module owns which domain.
 *   3. `UNSCOPED_REVIEWED_TYPES` stays a review record, not a dumping ground:
 *      an entry that later gains an owner must leave the list.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE — read this before trusting it
 *
 *   - It does NOT prove any read calls the gate. A future `getMetricSummary`
 *     that calls `resolveRichMetric` directly instead of the module-aware
 *     resolver would leak exactly as before and this test would stay green.
 *     Only the per-read tests in `mcp/__tests__/rich-reads-module-gate.test.ts`
 *     cover that, and only for the reads that exist today. There is no
 *     compile-time barrier stopping a new caller from reaching the ungated
 *     resolver — `resolveRichMetric` is still exported because
 *     `build-efficacy` and the tests use it for pure resolvability checks.
 *   - It does NOT prove the OWNERSHIP assignments are correct, only that they
 *     exist. Mapping SLEEP_SCORE to `sleep` is a human judgement; if it truly
 *     belonged to `recovery`, this test would be just as green.
 *   - It says nothing about the surfaces that gate on a module key directly
 *     rather than through a metric (`insights` for correlations, `doctorReport`
 *     for the aggregate). Those are covered by their own tests.
