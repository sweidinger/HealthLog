/**
 * v1.30.22 — the ONE table of "which module owns which data domain".
 *
 * Before this file the ownership map lived as a private const inside the
 * Coach snapshot builder, which made it reachable only by reads that route
 * through `buildCoachSnapshot`. Three read families deliberately bypass the
 * snapshot (the MCP rich reads, the correlations reader, the doctor-report
 * aggregate) and therefore inherited no gating at all — the module toggle and
 * the operator kill-switch above it were silently defeated on the one wire
 * that egresses to a third party.
 *
 * The fix is to hold the ownership map at the READ level rather than at each
 * call site: a read resolves its metric, asks this table who owns it, and
 * gates. A future read family that resolves a metric therefore cannot land
 * ungated without deliberately skipping the resolver.
 *
 * Two layers, matching how the metric registries are actually split:
 *
 *   1. `MODULE_SCOPED_SOURCES` — module key → the Coach scope-source tokens
 *      it owns. This is the map the snapshot builder has always used to
 *      narrow its sources; it now lives here and the builder imports it, so
 *      there is exactly one definition.
 *   2. `METRIC_STATUS_MODULE_OWNERS` — the reviewed ownership entries for the
 *      metric-status-only ids, which carry no signal-registry scope of their
 *      own and so cannot be derived from layer 1.
 *
 * `moduleForMeasurementType()` unions both and is keyed on `MeasurementType`
 * because that is what every resolution path in the rich reads produces and
 * what the underlying rollup query actually reads.

 * here would double-gate. `coach` is the surface being narrated, not a data
 * domain. `labs` / `achievements` / `insights` / `doctorReport` own no
 * measurement-level data domain — they gate whole surfaces instead, which is
 * why the correlations reader and the doctor-report aggregate gate on their
 * module key directly rather than through this table.

/**
 * Measurement types that resolve over the rich reads but that NO module owns —

 * These are not an oversight and not a backlog: they are the domains the

 * them either (none of their scope tokens appears in
 * {@link MODULE_SCOPED_SOURCES}), so gating them here would make the MCP wire
 * STRICTER than the app and the Coach — hiding data behind a toggle the user
 * never associated with it. Grouped by why:
 *
 *   - Core clinical figures every account carries: weight, pulse, blood
 *     pressure, BMI, body temperature.
 *   - Body composition: fat / lean / muscle / bone / water / visceral.
 *   - Activity volume: steps, distance, flights, active energy. Owned by no
 *     module — `workouts` gates workout SESSIONS, not ambient movement.
 *   - Gait and mobility, incl. the fall / walk-test / stair metrics.
 *   - Cardio-vascular readings with no module home: SpO2, respiratory rate,
 *     walking HR, pulse-wave velocity, vascular age, avg/max HR.
 *   - v1.25 clinical signals: grip strength, pain NRS, waist measures.
 *   - WRIST_TEMPERATURE and ENERGY_EXPENDITURE_KJ: plausible arguments exist
 *     for `sleep` and `workouts` respectively, but neither module claims them
 *     anywhere else in the tree, and guessing an owner would hide a metric
 *     behind an unrelated toggle. Left unowned deliberately rather than
 *     assigned on a hunch.
 *
 * This set exists so the structural test can distinguish "reviewed as
 * unscoped" from "nobody has looked at this yet" — a new resolvable metric
 * that is neither owned nor listed here fails the test.
