/**
 * Illness correlation engine — the READ layer (v1.18.1, Workstream B / P3).
 *
 * Resolves the per-vital per-day mean series the pure `computeIllnessCorrelation`
 * engine needs, then runs the engine. Two windows per vital, and the seam
 * between them is the BASELINE-CONTAMINATION GUARD:
 *
 *   baselineDays : [onset − lookback − BASELINE_WINDOW_DAYS, onset − lookback)
 *   episodeDays  : [onset − lookback, end]
 *
 * The baseline window ENDS strictly before the pre-onset lookback, so no day
 * inside (or just before) the episode can poison the baseline the episode is
 * measured against. This is the single most important reliability property of
 * the engine — a baseline that includes the illness days would shrink every
 * deviation toward zero and silently under-report the very anomaly we exist to
 * surface.
 *
 * Reads are DAY-native (the spread invariant forbids composing a band from a
 * coarser tier's `sd`): the rollup DAY tier when covered, a bounded per-type
 * live-SQL fallback on a coverage miss. EVERY per-day key is the USER'S local
 * day (`dayKeyForUserTz`), never a raw UTC slice — the onset/feltBetter markers
 * are already keyed in the user's tz, so the vital series must match or a
 * non-UTC user gets an off-by-one (a 03:00Z reading is local D−1 but UTC D).
 * Rollup DAY buckets are minted at the UTC midnight of the user-tz day, so
 * keying their `bucketStart` through `dayKeyForUserTz` is exact.
