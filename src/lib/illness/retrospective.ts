 *
 * Pure given a list of resolved episode summaries + their computed gaps. The
 * caller resolves the per-episode recovery-gap (via the correlation engine,
 * which is itself coverage-gated) and passes the numbers in; this layer only
 * aggregates. The aggregate is itself gated — with too few resolved episodes
 * to say anything honest, it reports the count but withholds the "typical
