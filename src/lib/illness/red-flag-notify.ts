/**
 * v1.18.4 — illness red-flag escalation push.
 *
 * The illness correlation engine (`computeIllnessCorrelation`) surfaces a
 * retrospective "seek care" red flag when a vital held an absolute clinical
 * floor for a sustained run (sustained low SpO2, sustained fever). Until now
 * that escalation only rendered in-app on the correlation surface; it never
 * left a push. This helper bridges it to the notification dispatcher so the
 * escalation reaches the user wherever they configured a channel.
 *
 * It dispatches at the URGENT level: every configured channel delivers at its
 * highest urgency (APNs time-sensitive, ntfy max, Web Push `Urgency: high`,
 * webhook `urgent`). There is NO dependency on APNs — an instance with only
 * ntfy / Web Push / Telegram / webhook / email still gets the escalation at
 * the strongest tier those channels support.
 *
 * Owner-scoped (the authenticated episode owner) and module-gated by the
 * caller (`requireIllnessEnabled`). De-duplicated through the `pushAttempt`
 * ledger: at most one escalation per episode per rolling window, so a
 * correlation surface that is re-read repeatedly never re-fires the alarm.
