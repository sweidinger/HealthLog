/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-E). Nightly Strain-score computation + store.
 *
 * Once a night this cron computes each eligible user's Strain score from
 * the day's per-workout heart-rate series (`WorkoutSamples`, WX-D) plus
 * active-energy burned, via Banister's TRIMP cardio-load model (see
 * `src/lib/insights/strain-score.ts`), and persists it as a `COMPUTED
 * STRAIN_SCORE` Measurement row. The score is never computed on a page
 * visit.
 *
 * Idempotent per user per day: the per-user persist upserts on
 * `(userId, type, source, externalId)` with `externalId = strain:YYYY-MM-DD`,
 * so a re-fired cron tick (or a manual re-run) overwrites the day's row in
 * place. A user with no usable cardio-load input that day gets NO row.
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` so pg-boss provisions it at boot; an
 * unregistered queue silently never drains.
