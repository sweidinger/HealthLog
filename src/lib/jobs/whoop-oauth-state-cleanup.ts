/**
 * v1.11.0 — daily cleanup for the `whoop_oauth_states` table.
 *
 * Mirrors `withings-oauth-state-cleanup`. The OAuth state ledger is single-use
 * — every happy-path + error-path branch in `whoop/callback` consumes its row,
 * so an abandoned row only lingers when the user closed the WHOOP approval tab
 * without bouncing back to the callback URL. The cookie + row TTL is 10
 * minutes, so once the timestamp blows the row is dead weight.
 *
 * Idempotent: a re-run within the same window matches zero rows the second time
 * because the first pass deleted everything older than `now()`.
