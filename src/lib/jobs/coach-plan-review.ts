/**
 * v1.22 (W9, C2) — n-of-1 experiment review worker.
 *
 * The genuinely-missing half of the n-of-1 loop. The review SURFACE already
 * exists: `coach-reminder-sweep` finds a CoachPlan whose `reviewDate` has passed
 * and mints a CoachReminder from the plan's own cue→action prose (the in-app
 * tile). What was missing is the READ-BACK — reading the experiment's result
 * back in the user's own before/after numbers and storing it.
 *
 * This worker consumes the sweep's output (it does NOT re-scan `reviewDate`, so
 * it never double-mints or races the sweep): for each minted plan-review
 * reminder whose plan is still `active` and has no outcome yet, it reads a
 * before/after window of the plan's target metric around the experiment's start,
 * builds a grounded, association-only outcome, writes `outcomeEncrypted`, and
 * flips the plan to `reviewed`. The user-visible read-back stays gated behind
 * `COACH_EXPERIMENT_VERDICT` (see `experiment-flag.ts`); this worker only
 * populates the substrate.
 *
 * Safety: association-only ("looks worth keeping", never "proven"/"works"),
 * honest-null on no measurable change, and NO cheerlead when a vital worsened —
 * a regression routes to the doctor, never a "great job". Every experiment is
 * behavioral (the plan extractor never records a clinical/dose trial); the
 * prompt + B0 cases enforce the refuse-clinical-experiment boundary.
