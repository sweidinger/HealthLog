/**
 * Automatic per-document plain-language summary, enqueued the moment a document
 * is stored (`POST /api/documents/inbound`). Fire-and-forget: the upload
 * response never blocks on or fails because of it.
 *
 * Unlike the on-demand summary route (which is transient — nothing persisted),
 * THIS path persists a short (3-4 sentence) descriptive summary ENCRYPTED on the
 * document row, generated ONCE. It runs ONLY when the user's `documentsAutoAiRead`
 * opt-in is ON — that flag is the standing AI-egress consent that removes the
 * per-document friction. With the opt-in OFF the job is a strict no-op and the
 * on-demand route stays the only way to get a summary.
 *
 * The gate order mirrors the vault's other AI paths (module gate is enforced at
 * the enqueueing upload route): load → opt-in ON → provider resolved (DOCUMENT
 * order, local-first) → egress consent re-asserted → budget reserved → generate
 * → persist encrypted. Every skip is graceful (no throw, no retry): an already-
 * summarised document, no configured provider, a spent budget, or a document the
 * picked provider cannot read all resolve to a clean no-op. The summary is
 * DESCRIPTIVE ONLY (interpretation boundary G7, enforced by `runDocumentSummary`).
 *
 * The queue MUST be registered in the maintenance registrar
 * (`src/lib/jobs/reminder/register-maintenance.ts`) so pg-boss provisions it.
