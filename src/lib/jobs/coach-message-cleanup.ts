/**
 * Daily cleanup for the `coach_messages` table.
 *
 * v1.18.7 retention (GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) "storage limitation"): the Coach
 * persists every turn's prose as an encrypted `encryptedContent` Bytes
 * column. The table is append-only and grows forever — a daily Coach user
 * accrues rows indefinitely with no lifecycle. The conversation history is
 * useful context, but stale beyond a year it is dead weight inflating the
 * table and the `(conversation_id, created_at)` indexes.
 *
 * Default retention is 365 days (configurable via COACH_MESSAGE_RETENTION_DAYS
 * env). Rows older than the cutoff are deleted in a single bulk `deleteMany`;
 * runs daily via pg-boss. The DELETE is keyed on `created_at` directly — the
 * pre-existing `(conversation_id, created_at)` index is not a perfect cover
 * for an unqualified `created_at` scan, but the trailing-edge delete touches
 * only the oldest sliver of the table.
 *
 * The retention floor is 30 days: a misconfigured tiny value never nukes
 * recent, in-context conversation history. Content stays encrypted at rest
 * until the moment it is hard-deleted; there is no plaintext path.
