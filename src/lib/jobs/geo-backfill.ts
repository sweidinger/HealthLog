/**
 * v1.4.27 B3 — Backfill `location` + `asn` + `carrier` on audit-log
 * rows that landed with the offline DB unavailable or with `ipwho.is`
 * timing out.
 *
 * The fire-and-forget lookup in `src/lib/auth/audit.ts` runs once at
 * audit-creation time. If the offline MMDB was missing on a host
 * (operator skipped the GeoLite2 fetch step) or if the online
 * provider was down, the row stays at `location IS NULL` forever
 * with no retry path. This helper walks those rows and re-resolves
 * them through the now-bundled offline databases.
 *
 * The scope is intentionally narrow:
 *
 *   - Only rows where `location IS NULL` and `ipAddress IS NOT NULL`.
 *     A null IP has no signal to backfill against.
 *   - Only rows from the last 30 days. Rows beyond that retention
 *     window typically belong to deleted users or have aged out of
 *     the operational triage window where the `location` chip
 *     matters.
 *   - Capped at 500 rows per pass. Each row spends up to 3 s on the
 *     `lookupIpLocation` online fallback (offline MMDB miss → ipwho.is
 *     timeout), so 500 rows × 3 s caps the worst-case pass at ~25 min
 *     and keeps the hourly cron from stacking. Earlier passes ran at
 *     5 000 rows, which let a single backfill burst block for ~4 h and
 *     starve the next scheduled run. The trade-off: a tenant with a
 *     large null-`location` backlog now drains over multiple hourly
 *     passes instead of one mega-pass — fine because the helper is
 *     idempotent and the admin sign-in overview tolerates a stale
 *     Standort cell for the few hours convergence takes.
 *
 * Idempotent: a row that the resolver still cannot match (private IP
 * sneaking through CF egress, freshly-allocated range the GeoLite2
 * release hasn't picked up yet) stays NULL and the next pass tries
 * again. The cap is per-call, not per-row, so the helper can be
 * scheduled at any cadence without doubling up.
 *
 * No notifications, no event ladder — the maintainer can read the
 * counts off the returned summary and decide whether to keep
 * scheduling.
