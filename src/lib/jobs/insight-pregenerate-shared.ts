/**
 * v1.8.7.1 — generator-free contract for the insight-pregenerate queue.
 *
 * The on-demand warm route (`POST /api/insights/pregenerate`) enqueues a
 * forced full-warm job here without importing the concrete generators
 * (which would pull the whole `comprehensive-generate` + seven `*-status`
 * tree into the route bundle and risk an import cycle). The worker-only
 * pipeline (`runInsightPregenerate`, `forceWarmUser`) lives in
 * `insight-pregenerate.ts`, which re-exports the queue name from here so
 * there is a single source of truth.
 *
 * Mirrors the `insight-status-generate-shared.ts` split exactly: queue
 * name + payload type + enqueue helper in the generator-free module, the
 * concrete dispatch in the worker module.
