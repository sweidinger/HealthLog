/**
 * v1.11.0 W3 — generator-free contract for the period-narrative warm queue.
 *
 * The read-only GET route enqueues a single-user warm here without importing
 * the concrete generator (which would pull the provider chain + W2 context
 * assembler into the route bundle). The worker-only pipeline
 * (`runPeriodNarrativeWarm`) lives in `period-narrative-warm.ts`, which
 * re-exports the queue name from here so there is one source of truth.
 *
 * Mirrors the `insight-pregenerate-shared.ts` split exactly: queue name +
 * payload type + cron + enqueue helper here, the concrete dispatch in the
 * worker module.
