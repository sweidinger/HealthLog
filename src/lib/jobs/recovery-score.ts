/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-C). Nightly Recovery-score computation +
 * store.
 *
 * Once a night this cron computes each eligible user's Recovery score from
 * their already-stored nightly signals (RHR / HRV / sleep / respiratory
 * deviation from the personal baseline) and persists it as a `COMPUTED`
 * `RECOVERY_SCORE` Measurement row (see `src/lib/insights/recovery-score.ts`).
 * The score is NEVER computed on a page visit — the read surfaces query the
 * stored row like any other daily series.
 *
 * Idempotent per user per day: the per-user persist upserts on
 * `(userId, type, source, externalId)` with `externalId = recovery:YYYY-MM-DD`,
 * so a re-fired cron tick (or a manual re-run) overwrites the day's row in
 * place rather than duplicating it. A user whose readiness blend is below the
 * minimum-component floor gets NO row that night — the series stays honest.
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` so pg-boss provisions it at boot; an
 * unregistered queue silently never drains (the recurring past bug this
 * comment guards against).
