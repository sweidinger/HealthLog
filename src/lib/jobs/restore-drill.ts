/**
 * Monthly off-host backup restore drill (v1.16.4).
 *
 * A backup that has never been read back is a hope, not a backup. The
 * off-host uploader (`offhost-backup.ts`) writes an encrypted snapshot
 * per user every night, but nothing on the write path proves the
 * objects are still fetchable, decryptable under the CURRENT
 * `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and structurally parseable. A silent key
 * rotation mishap or a bucket-side corruption would only surface on
 * the day a real restore is needed.
 *
 * This drill closes that gap once a month: fetch the most recent
 * backup object, decrypt it, JSON-parse it, and sanity-check the
 * payload shape. It deliberately performs NO database restore — the
 * drill validates the artefact, not the import path. The result is
 * surfaced through the wide-event meta on success and through
 * `reportWorkerError` (stderr + GlitchTip) on any failure, so a broken
 * backup chain pages the operator eleven months before it matters.
 *
 * Schedule: 04:11 on the 1st of each month (`11 4 1 * *`), after the
 * 02:30 nightly upload and the 03:xx cleanup window, on a minute slot
 * no other cron uses.
