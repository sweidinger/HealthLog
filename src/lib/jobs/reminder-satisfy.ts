/**
 * v1.18.1 — enqueue helper for the eventful Vorsorge-reminder satisfaction
 * queue. Mirrors `pr-detection.ts`: the Next.js ingest routes import
 * `enqueueReminderSatisfy` and never touch pg-boss directly, the worker
 * binds the handler in `reminder-worker.ts`, and the 15-min
 * measurement-reminder cron is the idempotent safety-net for any ingest
 * path that forgets to enqueue (or any job that fails to land).
 *
 * Why a queue and not an inline call on the ingest path: the batch route's
 * own comment warns against hooking the hot iOS batch-ingest path. The
 * matcher re-queries the user's measurements/labs, so keep it off the
 * request and out of the sync worker's tight loop — enqueue
 * fire-and-forget, resolve in the worker.
