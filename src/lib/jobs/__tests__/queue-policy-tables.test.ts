/**
 * Dead-policy guard, in the same spirit as the v1.4.37 dead-queue guards.
 *
 * A queue's `singletonKey` only de-duplicates if its registrar names a policy
 * for it: pg-boss constrains `singleton_key` through partial unique indexes
 * scoped by queue policy, and the default `standard` policy has none. So the
 * enqueue site and the registrar entry are two halves of one guarantee that
 * live in different files, and nothing in the type system couples them —
 * deleting the registrar entry leaves the `singletonKey` at the call site
 * looking entirely correct while it silently stops doing anything.
 *
 * These assertions are that coupling. Each queue below is listed with the
 * policy its call site depends on; dropping or weakening an entry turns this
 * suite red instead of quietly restoring the storm.
 *
 * The behavioural proof that the policies mean what the names say lives in
 * `tests/integration/queue-singleton-policy.integration.test.ts`, which runs a
 * real pg-boss against a real Postgres.
