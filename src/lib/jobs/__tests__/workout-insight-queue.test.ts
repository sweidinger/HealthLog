/**
 * v1.4.37 dead-queue guard for the `workout-insight-generate` queue.
 *
 * This queue fails open in the worst possible way. Nothing warms it, no cron
 * touches it, and no read path triggers it — the ONLY thing that ever puts work
 * on it is the arrival spine's dispatch. So if the queue name is missing from
 * `allQueues`, pg-boss never provisions it, every `boss.send` resolves
 * successfully, every job vanishes, and the only symptom is that no workout
 * ever gets a paragraph. That is indistinguishable from the feature's own
 * honest empty state, which is exactly why it needs a structural guard rather
 * than a behavioural one.
 *
 * Source-text assertions over the registrar, matching the shape of the sibling
 * `*-queue.test.ts` guards.
