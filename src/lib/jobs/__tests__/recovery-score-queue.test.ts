/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-C). Recovery-score queue registration guard.
 *
 * Same source-text-grep approach as the other queue-wiring guards: assert
 * the queue is imported, registered in `allQueues`, scheduled, and wired to
 * a `boss.work` handler — without booting pg-boss + Prisma. An unregistered
 * queue silently never drains (the recurring past bug this guards against).
 *
 * Also pins the iOS-write rejection of the server-owned COMPUTED source on
 * the batch ingest route: the `batchSourceEnum` allowlist must stay exactly
 * `{APPLE_HEALTH, MANUAL}`, so COMPUTED (like WITHINGS / IMPORT) can never be
 * forged by a client.
