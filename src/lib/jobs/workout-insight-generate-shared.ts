/**
 * Generator-free enqueue contract for the per-workout Activity Insight.
 *
 * The split matters structurally, not stylistically. The data-arrival spine's
 * central cost claim — that the worker cannot spend a token — is enforced by a
 * module-graph test that BFS-walks the static imports of
 * `@/lib/jobs/data-arrival`. The spine dispatches THIS surface, so if the
 * dispatch pulled in the generator, the generator's provider clients would
 * become reachable from the spine and that guard would go red, correctly.
 *
 * So the spine imports only this module: a queue name, a payload, and a
 * `boss.send`. The worker that resolves a provider lives in
 * `workout-insight-generate.ts` and is imported solely by the worker registrar.
