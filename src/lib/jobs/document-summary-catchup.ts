/**
 * Catch-up pass for documents stored BEFORE the auto-read opt-in was turned on.
 *
 * The per-document summary job is enqueued at UPLOAD time and no-ops when
 * `documentsAutoAiRead` is OFF. That leaves an obvious hole: a user who uploads
 * their vault first and flips the toggle afterwards gets nothing. Every document
 * they already hold was enqueued while the flag was OFF, the job no-opped, and
 * nothing ever re-enqueues them — so the switch reads as broken. It only ever
 * worked for documents uploaded after the flip.
 *
 * A genuine OFF→ON transition on `PATCH /api/auth/me/documents-auto-ai-read`
 * enqueues one pass of this job, which walks the user's un-summarised documents
 * and enqueues the ordinary per-document summary job for each.
 *
 * What this job does NOT do is grant anything. It only enqueues; every gate
 * still runs inside `runDocumentSummaryJob` — the opt-in is re-read, the egress
 * consent is re-asserted per document, and the daily token budget is reserved
 * and reconciled exactly as on the upload path. Retroactive work is not a reason
 * to skip a consent receipt or a budget ceiling, so it does not.
 *
 * Bounded and idempotent:
 *   - the candidate set is documents with NO summary, so a document drops out
 *     the moment its summary lands and a re-run cannot redo finished work;
 *   - an id-cursor forward walk capped at `MAX_ENQUEUES_PER_RUN` (see the
 *     constant for why that number) keeps one flip from queueing a whole vault;
 *   - the per-user `singletonKey` plus the queue's `short` policy collapses a
 *     second flip while a pass is still queued, and the per-document enqueue
 *     carries its own singleton on top;
 *   - `runDocumentSummaryJob` skips any document that already has a summary, so
 *     even a duplicate that slips past both singletons is a cheap no-op.
 *
 * The queue MUST be registered in the maintenance registrar
 * (`src/lib/jobs/reminder/register-maintenance.ts`) so pg-boss provisions it.
