/**
 * v1.15.20 — proactive Coach nudge (MVP).
 *
 * One daily cron tick (05:15 Europe/Berlin, after the nightly score
 * passes have settled) evaluates a small set of DETERMINISTIC triggers
 * per user and — when one fires — dispatches a single `COACH_NUDGE`
 * notification deep-linking to `/coach`. No AI call happens
 * here: the triggers are plain arithmetic over already-persisted rows;
 * the Coach conversation the nudge invites the user into is where the
 * model gets involved.
 *
 * Gates, in order (the `status-cron-candidates` pattern):
 *   1. Operator kill-switch via `getAssistantFlags().coach` — the
 *      master assistant switch forces this off too.
 *   2. Per-user `disableCoach: false` — no Coach surface, no nudge.
 *   3. A working provider (`userRowHasProviderCredential`, including
 *      the operator's shared key) — a nudge into a Coach that cannot
 *      answer is worse than silence.
 *   4. Per-user opt-out: `notificationPrefs.coach.nudgesEnabled`
 *      (default ON; Settings → Notifications). v1.16.5 adds per-group
 *      toggles underneath (medication / vitals / routine) — a disabled
 *      group's triggers are never evaluated for that user.
 *   5. Frequency cap: at most one nudge per rolling window — 7 days by
 *      default, 14 when the user picked "biweekly" — anchored on the
 *      `push_attempts` ledger (`eventType = COACH_NUDGE`,
 *      `result = "ok"`) — no new table, 90-day retention dwarfs the
 *      14-day lookback, and a failed dispatch leaves the slot free.
 *
 * Triggers (first hit wins, evaluated cheapest-first):
 *   - `compliance`: 7-day medication adherence < 60 % with at least
 *     5 due doses (deliberate skips excluded — a planned break is not
 *     a compliance problem).
 *   - `bp`: 7-day systolic mean above the user's effective target
 *     (override-aware via `getEffectiveRange`) with ≥ 3 readings.
 *   - `score`: recovery score falling sharply — the last 7-day mean
 *     sits ≥ 15 points under the previous 7-day mean (≥ 3 samples in
 *     each window).
 *   - `selfContext` (v1.16.0): the self-context questionnaire is
 *     incomplete or 60+ days stale AND the user actively talks to the
 *     Coach (a CoachUsage row in the last 14 days) — a gentle check-up
 *     nudge to refresh the personal context the Coach reads. Presence
 *     is checked on the encrypted columns only; nothing is decrypted
 *     during trigger evaluation.
 *   - `weight` (v1.16.5): the weekly weight mean sits outside the
 *     user's effective green range AND has drifted further away from
 *     it than the previous week's mean (≥ 0.5 kg) — trend drift, not a
 *     single outlier reading.
 *   - `sleepDebt` (v1.16.5): at least 4 of the last 7 nights fall
 *     clearly (0.5 h margin) under the user's effective sleep floor,
 *     with at least 5 recorded nights so a sparse week stays silent.
 *   - `measurementGap` (v1.16.5): a previously active account
 *     (measurements on ≥ 10 distinct days in the preceding 3 weeks)
 *     records NOTHING for 7 straight days — an abrupt stop, whether
 *     disengagement or a silently broken sync, is worth a check-in.
 *
 * Trigger groups (v1.16.5, per-group opt-outs in the prefs blob):
 *   medication → compliance; vitals → bp / score / weight / sleepDebt;
 *   routine → measurementGap / selfContext.
 *
 * Copy (v1.25.0): a warm, localized, deterministic TEMPLATE. The title
 * carries a greeting with the user's name ("Guten Morgen, …" / "Hey …",
 * rotating; the 05:15 cron makes a morning frame safe); the body carries
 * one calm observation and a gentle invite, never an imperative. When the
 * user set a Coach focus the body adds a NON-QUOTING acknowledgment — the
 * raw self-context sentence is never read back, only its presence
 * referenced. Nothing is decrypted here; the focus is a presence flag.
 *
 * AI enrichment (v1.25.0, opt-in, default OFF): when the user opted in AND
 * a provider is healthy, the body is composed through the model instead of
 * the template — under a per-user budget gate, a tight per-call timeout and
 * a per-tick ceiling. ANY error/timeout/budget falls silently back to the
 * deterministic template, which is always the safe default.
 *
 * Anti-nag (NORTH-STAR): the rolling frequency cap already prevents two
 * nudges in a window (so never two days running), nothing-to-say is silence
 * by construction (no trigger → no nudge), and a user who engaged the Coach
 * in the last ~24 h is skipped.
