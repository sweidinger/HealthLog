/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-E). Nightly Stress-score computation + store.
 *
 * Once a night this cron computes each eligible user's Stress score from
 * their intra-day `HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY` (SDNN) samples and persists it as
 * a `COMPUTED STRESS_SCORE` Measurement row (see
 * `src/lib/insights/stress-score.ts`). The score is an HONEST HRV-derived
 * proxy — Apple Watch has no EDA sensor; it is NEVER a direct stress
 * measurement. The score is never computed on a page visit.
 *
 * Idempotent per user per day: the per-user persist upserts on
 * `(userId, type, source, externalId)` with `externalId = stress:YYYY-MM-DD`,
 * so a re-fired cron tick (or a manual re-run) overwrites the day's row in
 * place. A user without enough intra-day SDNN samples or a usable baseline
 * gets NO row that night — the series stays honest.
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` so pg-boss provisions it at boot; an
 * unregistered queue silently never drains.
