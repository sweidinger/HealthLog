 * one job per user still holding live legacy step rows, the per-user
 * handler runs `consolidateLegacySteps`, and the pass is idempotent
 * across reboots (consolidated rows are soft-deleted so they drop off
 * the discovery list).
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts` so pg-boss provisions it at boot;
 * an unregistered queue silently never drains.
