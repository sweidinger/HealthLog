/**
 * v1.4.34 — pg-boss handler for the `apple-health-import` queue.
 *
 * The kick-off endpoint (`POST /api/import/apple-health-export`,
 * `POST /api/admin/import-apple-health-export`) writes the upload to
 * `/tmp`, creates an `ImportJob` row in `queued`, and sends the
 * payload below to this queue. The handler:
 *
 *   1. Resolves the mirror `ImportJob` row by `pgBossJobId`.
 *   2. Extracts `export.xml` from the upload's ZIP archive.
 *   3. Streams the XML through `streamParseExportXml()`, which
 *      UPSERTs `Measurement` and `Workout` rows while feeding a
 *      live progress snapshot back onto the `ImportJob` row.
 *   4. Marks the row `done` with the terminal `ImportJobResult`
 *      envelope on success, or `failed` with a reason string on
 *      throw.
 *   5. Cleans up the upload + extracted XML so `/tmp` does not
 *      accumulate gigabyte tails on the worker host.
 *
 * Concurrency: 1 per host. The parse loop is CPU-bound and a
 * concurrent second import would race the first for RSS; the
 * pg-boss `boss.work` registration in `reminder-worker.ts` caps
 * `localConcurrency: 1`.
 *
 * Locks per `.planning/research/v1434-r-1-xml-import.md` §5.1.

 * so the operator can re-upload (and, post-issue-#486, so the kick-off
 * dedup no longer short-circuits future re-uploads onto a dead job).
 *
 * The reconcile is deliberately NOT unconditional. In a multi-replica
 * or rolling-deploy topology a booting worker must not flip a row that
 * another live worker is actively parsing. It therefore keeps a
 * non-terminal row alive when BOTH:
 *   - pg-boss still reports its backing job in a live state
 *     (`active` / `created` / `retry`), AND
 *   - the row's `updatedAt` heartbeat is fresher than

 * A row is reconciled to `failed` when its pg-boss job is gone (null,
 * archived) or terminal (`completed` / `cancelled` / `failed`), OR when
 * its heartbeat has gone stale (owner died but pg-boss has not yet
 * expired the job). This keeps the single-worker default self-healing
 * truly-stuck jobs while never racing a live import in another worker.
 *
 * If the boss handle is unavailable (should not happen — reconcile runs
 * after `setGlobalBoss()`), it falls back to the heartbeat bound alone.
 * Idempotent — re-running on a clean startup is a no-op.
