/**
 * S4 — the `morning-digest-refresh` worker.
 *
 * Runs ONE extra insight generation per user per local morning, event-driven
 * off the arrival of last night's sleep (never warm-on-mount, never per page
 * visit). It re-runs the SAME comprehensive pipeline the nightly
 * `insight-pregenerate` cron uses — forced so the 24 h cache short-circuit is
 * bypassed — then stamps `User.morningDigestRefreshedOn` so the daily digest
 * flips the day `provisional → final`.
 *
 * Cheap by construction: the generator's own content-hash gate turns a
 * no-change regeneration into an `unchanged` timestamp refresh with no provider
 * call, so a morning whose sleep did not actually move the feature snapshot
 * costs a hash compare, not an LLM round-trip. A real change — last night's
 * sleep now folded into the features — regenerates the briefing paragraph AND
 * warms the score's read path.
 *
 * Honest degradation (§E): on a hard generation failure the marker is NOT
 * stamped, so the day stays `provisional` and the digest keeps showing the
 * sleep-pending note. The generator already recorded the omit-reason via
 * `recordBriefingFailure` on its failure paths, and we re-enqueue the SAME
 * 45-minute bounded retry the nightly cron uses (`enqueuePregenerateFailureRetry`)
 * — no parallel freshness machinery is invented here.
 *
 * Idempotency: a second run for the same local morning no-ops on the marker
 * re-check. The enqueue-side `singletonKey` collapses the concurrent burst; the
 * marker is the durable "already done" guard the singleton cannot provide once
 * the first job has completed.
