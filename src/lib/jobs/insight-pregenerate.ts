/**
 * v1.7.0 W6 — nightly insight pre-generation cron.
 *
 * Closes the gap the R-firstpaint audit surfaced: before this cron,
 * every daily briefing was generated lazily on the first `/insights`
 * mount after the 24 h cache expired, blocking that request on the
 * provider chain. This cron pre-generates the comprehensive insight
 * (which carries the `dailyBriefing` block) overnight so the mount-time
 * advisor POST is always a pure cache read, and the v1.7.0 dashboard
 * snapshot embeds a `briefingState: "ready"` block instead of
 * `"preparing"`.
 *
 * v1.8.0 — warm the per-metric assessment caches too, so the first
 * `/insights` mount of the morning is a cache read instead of one live
 * status generation per card.
 *
 * v1.16.8 — the warm is single-locale (the user's resolved locale) and
 * refill-only: every generator runs its own content-hash gate, so a card
 * whose underlying data did not change since its last real assessment
 * costs a cache-row refresh, not an LLM call. The comprehensive write no
 * longer evicts the per-status rows, so there is nothing to force-refill;
 * a second locale (e.g. an English iOS client against a German account)
 * warms lazily through the read-path enqueue on its first visit.
 *
 * Runs once nightly at 04:30 Europe/Berlin — inside the existing
 * 03:xx–04:xx maintenance window, after the feedback aggregator (04:00)
 * and the cumulative drain (03:30) so the late-night CPU profile stays
 * coherent.
 *
 * Budget gate (R-firstpaint §6 tertiary risk): a nightly fan-out across
 * every user could spike provider cost. Two layers guard it:
 *   1. A per-user rate-limit bucket (`insight-pregenerate:${userId}`,
 *      1 generation / 20 h) so the cron can never double-generate a
 *      user the on-demand route already refreshed today.
 *   2. A hard per-run batch cap (`PREGENERATE_BATCH_CAP`) so a single
 *      tick processes at most N users; the discovery query is ordered
 *      oldest-cache-first so the staleest users are served first and
 *      the long tail catches up over successive nights.
 *
 * The discovery query selects only users that are worth a generation:
 * coach surface enabled (`disableCoach = false`) AND a stale-or-missing
 * cache (`insightsCachedAt IS NULL OR < now - PREGENERATE_STALE_MS`,
 * see the constant for why that window is one hour). Whether the user
 * has a configured provider is confirmed inside
 * `generateComprehensiveInsight` (returns `skipped: no-provider`), so a
 * provider-less account costs one cheap chain-resolve and no LLM call.
 *
 * Recurring pg-boss task — never runs inside an HTTP request and never
 * shells out to `tsx` (CLAUDE.md DO-NOTs).

 * enqueuing endpoint's short anti-spam rate-limit.
 *
 * Safety is preserved by the helpers it reuses, not by a budget gate:
 *   - The comprehensive generator no-ops to `{ status: "skipped" }` when
 *     no provider is configured (no LLM call).
 *   - `warmGenericMetricCaches` filters to metrics the user has rows for
 *     via one grouped read, so an empty metric never reaches the provider.
 *   - Each generator is idempotent — re-running it just rewrites the same
 *     cache row; concurrent enqueues collapse via the queue
 *     `singletonKey`, and the content-hash gates collapse a same-data
 *     re-run into a timestamp refresh.
 *
 * Like the nightly cron (v1.16.8), the forced path warms ONLY the
 * caller's resolved locale — the cross-locale per-status eviction that
 * once required dual-locale refills is gone, and a second locale a user
 * actually reads warms lazily through the read-path enqueue.
 *
 * The three sections are decoupled: the comprehensive step runs under its
 * own bounded budget (`COMPREHENSIVE_WARM_TIMEOUT_MS`) and its
 * failure / timeout / skip is non-fatal — the per-status (7) and
 * generic-metric (~30) warm passes ALWAYS run afterwards. The earlier
 * design short-circuited both passes on a non-`generated`/`cached`
 * comprehensive, so a single slow briefing generation left every card cold
 * and the user back on the lazy 30–60 s on-first-click path. The per-card
 * generators each resolve their own provider chain and bound their own
 * provider call, so a missing provider costs a cheap chain-resolve and a
 * degraded one is capped per card — running them after a failed
 * comprehensive can never multiply a stall. The result reports each
 * section's outcome independently so a partial warm is observable.

  //      hour stays failed for most causes (broken key, dead local
  //      endpoint); re-attempting on every page-open re-runs the full
  //      feature extraction + provider stall each time.
  //   3. daily cap — at most FORCE_WARM_DAILY_LIMIT forced attempts per
  //      rolling 24 h, so even a client bug that defeats 1+2 cannot turn
