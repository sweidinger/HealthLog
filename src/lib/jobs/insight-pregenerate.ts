/**
 * v1.7.0 W6 — nightly insight pre-generation cron.
 *
 * Closes the gap the R-firstpaint audit surfaced: before this cron,
 * every daily briefing was generated lazily on the first `/insights`
 * mount after the 24 h cache expired, blocking that request on the
 * provider chain. This cron pre-generates the comprehensive insight
 * (which carries the `dailyBriefing` block) overnight so the mount-time
 * advisor POST is always a pure cache read, and the v1.7.0 dashboard
 * snapshot embeds a `briefingState: "ready"` block instead of
 * `"preparing"`.
 *
 * v1.8.0 — warm the per-metric assessment caches too. The comprehensive
 * generator evicts the seven `insights.<scope>-status.<locale>` caches
 * as part of its write (so a stale comprehensive insight can never leave
 * a stale per-metric card behind) but does NOT re-fill them. Before this,
 * the morning after the cron ran the per-metric status caches were
 * empty, so the first `/insights` mount still ran one live status
 * generation per card. After a successful comprehensive generation this
 * cron now forces the seven `*StatusForUser` generators so their caches
 * are warm, not empty, by the user's first visit.
 *
 * Runs once nightly at 04:30 Europe/Berlin — inside the existing
 * 03:xx–04:xx maintenance window, after the feedback aggregator (04:00)
 * and the cumulative drain (03:30) so the late-night CPU profile stays
 * coherent.
 *
 * Budget gate (R-firstpaint §6 tertiary risk): a nightly fan-out across
 * every user could spike provider cost. Two layers guard it:
 *   1. A per-user rate-limit bucket (`insight-pregenerate:${userId}`,
 *      1 generation / 20 h) so the cron can never double-generate a
 *      user the on-demand route already refreshed today.
 *   2. A hard per-run batch cap (`PREGENERATE_BATCH_CAP`) so a single
 *      tick processes at most N users; the discovery query is ordered
 *      oldest-cache-first so the staleest users are served first and
 *      the long tail catches up over successive nights.
 *
 * The discovery query selects only users that are worth a generation:
 * coach surface enabled (`disableCoach = false`) AND a stale-or-missing
 * cache (`insightsCachedAt IS NULL OR < now - 20h`). Whether the user
 * has a configured provider is confirmed inside
 * `generateComprehensiveInsight` (returns `skipped: no-provider`), so a
 * provider-less account costs one cheap chain-resolve and no LLM call.
 *
 * Recurring pg-boss task — never runs inside an HTTP request and never
 * shells out to `tsx` (CLAUDE.md DO-NOTs).
