/**
 * S4 — generator-free contract for the `morning-digest-refresh` queue.
 *
 * The sleep-arrival trigger (`@/lib/daily/morning-refresh-trigger`) — reached
 * from the Withings, WHOOP, and Apple-Health sleep-write seams — enqueues a
 * debounced morning refresh here WITHOUT importing the comprehensive generator
 * (which would drag the whole insight tree into every sleep-sync bundle and
 * risk an import cycle through the transports). The worker-only pipeline
 * (`runMorningDigestRefresh`) lives in `morning-digest-refresh.ts`, which
 * re-exports the queue name from here so there is a single source of truth.
 *
 * Mirrors the `insight-pregenerate-shared.ts` split exactly: queue name +
 * payload type + enqueue helper in the generator-free module, the concrete
 * dispatch in the worker module.

/**
 * Fire-and-forget enqueue for the sleep-arrival trigger. The `singletonKey`
 * carries the user AND the local date, so the many sleep samples of one night
 * collapse into ONE queued job: while a refresh for this morning is
 * created/active no duplicate can be inserted. Once it completes, the durable
 * `User.morningDigestRefreshedOn` marker (re-checked in the handler AND
 * pre-checked in the trigger) stops any later sample from re-running it — the
 * pair is at-most-once per user per local morning.
 *
 * The key alone does NOT buy that: pg-boss only constrains `singleton_key`
 * when the queue carries a policy that indexes it, and under the default
 * `standard` policy no such index exists, so this key coalesced nothing at all
 * until the queue was given `exclusive` in `reminder/register-status.ts`. If
 * that entry is ever removed, this debounce silently disappears again — the two
 * belong together.
 *
 * No `singletonSeconds`: a time-slot throttle would let a second morning's
 * refresh be swallowed if it fell inside the window, and its wall-clock
 * `floor()` bucketing cannot express a user's local date anyway; the
 * local-date-scoped key plus the `exclusive` policy is exactly the debounce we
 * want. No-ops cleanly when no global boss instance is
 * available (a web process without an embedded worker) — the next sleep
 * landing, and the nightly cron, remain the catch-net.
