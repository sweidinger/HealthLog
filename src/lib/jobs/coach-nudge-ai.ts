/**
 * v1.25.0 — AI enrichment for the proactive Coach nudge (opt-in).
 *
 * The deterministic warm template (`buildCoachNudgePayload`) is always the
 * DEFAULT and the fail-closed fallback. When the user opted in
 * (`coach.nudgeAiComposed`) AND a provider is healthy, the 05:15 tick composes
 * the nudge BODY through the model instead — the greeting title stays
 * deterministic so the warm, name-led opener is guaranteed regardless of the
 * model's output.
 *
 * Hard guards (non-negotiable):
 *   - a CONSENT gate: a chain that could egress via the operator's
 *     server-managed credential requires an active `ai_coach` / `ai_full`
 *     receipt. The PHI volume here is small (an abstract trigger topic plus
 *     the deterministic template body) but it is still the user's health
 *     situation leaving the server on a credential they did not contract, and
 *     this tick runs unattended — so it carries the same receipt requirement
 *     as the interactive Coach;
 *   - per-user daily BUDGET gate (the same reserve/reconcile ledger the Coach
 *     chat uses, with the chain-aware daily cap);
 *   - a tight per-call TIMEOUT (≤ ~9 s) on both the provider `timeoutMs` and a
 *     belt-and-suspenders `AbortSignal`;
 *   - a per-tick CEILING (a call count + a wall-clock deadline) so the
 *     SEQUENTIAL tick cannot stall across the user base on provider latency;
 *   - ANY error / timeout / budget refusal / unsafe output → return null and
 *     the caller keeps the template.
 *
 * The same content rules as the template apply to the model's output, enforced
 * server-side: the outbound safety screen (`screenCoachReply`) rejects a
 * dose-prescription or a fabricated risk score, the prompt forbids quoting the
 * user's words / inventing figures / imperatives, and the body is length- and
 * shape-bounded before it can ship. The user's raw self-context focus is NEVER
 * passed to the model — only its presence, abstractly.
