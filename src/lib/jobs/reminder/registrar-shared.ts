/**
 * Shared plumbing for the domain-grouped queue registrars.
 *
 * v1.18.1 — `startReminderWorker()` was a 2143-LOC monolith that declared
 * every pg-boss queue name, listed them in one `allQueues` array, scheduled
 * every cron, and bound every `boss.work` handler inline. It is now decomposed
 * into domain registrars (integration-sync, status, rollup, reminders,
 * maintenance) under `src/lib/jobs/reminder/`. Each registrar owns the four
 * facts the v1.4.37 dead-queue guards pin — the queue-name constant, its
 * `allQueues` membership, its `[QUEUE, CRON]` schedule tuple, and its
 * `boss.work(QUEUE, …, handler)` binding — so a queue can never be declared
 * without being provisioned, scheduled, and drained. The boot file composes
 * the registrars; the guards follow the wiring into each registrar module.
 *
 * Every registrar returns the queue names it created so the boot file can
 * assert a single aggregate `allQueues` (defence in depth: the per-registrar
 * arrays AND the boot-level union both have to agree).

/**
 * The pg-boss queue policies this codebase names explicitly. `standard` —
 * pg-boss's default — is deliberately absent: under `standard` NO partial
 * unique index covers `singleton_key` at all, so a bare `singletonKey` on a
 * `send()` is inert and de-duplicates nothing. A queue that wants
 * de-duplication has to name one of the two policies below.
 *
 * From the partial unique indexes pg-boss 12.26 creates on the shared
 * `job_common` table:
 *
 *   - `short`     → UNIQUE (name, COALESCE(singleton_key,'')) WHERE state = 'created'
 *                   Collapses duplicate sends only while a job is still QUEUED.
 *                   Once it goes active, a fresh send is admitted again.
 *   - `exclusive` → UNIQUE (name, COALESCE(singleton_key,'')) WHERE state <= 'active'
 *                   Collapses duplicate sends while a job is queued OR active
 *                   OR waiting out a retry backoff.
 *
 * Picking between them is a correctness question, not a taste question:
 *
 *   - `short` when the handler re-reads current state at run time. Suppressing
 *     a send while an identical job is still QUEUED is then provably safe —
 *     that job has read nothing yet and will observe the newer write when it
 *     starts. Suppressing a send after the reader already STARTED would strand
 *     the newer write, which is why these queues must not be `exclusive`.
 *   - `exclusive` when a second concurrent run is pure duplicated work AND the
 *     enqueue side is self-converging — a discovery pass that re-enqueues on
 *     the next boot or cron tick while the work is still outstanding.
 *
 * On a conflict pg-boss inserts with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING ... RETURNING`, so
 * `boss.send()` resolves to `null` instead of throwing. Every enqueue helper in
 * this tree already counts a null id as `skipped`.

 * Bring the policy of ALREADY-EXISTING queues in line with the tables below.
 *
 * Why this is needed at all: pg-boss's `create_queue()` SQL function ends in
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so passing `{ policy }` to `boss.createQueue()`
 * only takes effect the first time a queue is provisioned. Every queue on an
 * already-running instance was created under the default `standard` policy, and
 * `boss.updateQueue()` rejects a policy change outright ("queue policy cannot be
 * changed after creation"). Without this reconcile the policy tables would be
 * correct on a fresh database and completely inert on every existing
 * deployment — a change that tests green and fixes nothing.
 *
 * Why writing the column directly is sound here: the partial unique indexes for
 * every policy are created once on the shared `job_common` table at schema
 * setup (this deployment does not use per-queue table partitioning), so the
 * index a newly-claimed policy needs already exists. A job row's own `policy`
 * value is resolved by joining `pgboss.queue` at insert time, so a changed
 * column takes effect on the next `send()` without a worker restart and without
 * depending on pg-boss's in-process queue cache. Jobs already in flight keep
 * the policy they were inserted under and simply do not participate in the new
 * index, which is the correct transitional behaviour.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only queue names this codebase decided on, only
 * where the stored policy actually differs, parameter-bound, and never a change
 * to a queue absent from the tables.
