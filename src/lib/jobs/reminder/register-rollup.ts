/**
 * Rollup / consolidation queue registrar.
 *
 * Owns the pre-aggregation + consolidation tier: measurement-rollup recompute
 * + boot-backfill, mood-rollup recompute + boot-backfill, medication-compliance
 * boot-backfill, legacy step consolidation, daily-mean consolidation, dense
 * intra-day retention, and the nightly per-sample cumulative drain (which also
 * folds the daily-mean + dense-retention passes onto the same tick). Includes
 * the boot-time discovery enqueues for the self-converging backfills.
 *
 * v1.4.37 dead-queue contract: every queue name appears in `allQueues`, its
 * cron (where it has one) appears as a `[QUEUE, CRON]` tuple in `schedules`,
 * and a `boss.work(QUEUE, …, handler)` binding drains it. The
 * `drain-cumulative-queue`, `mean-consolidation-queue`, and
 * `stress-strain-retention-queue` (dense-retention facet) guards read THIS
 * module.

 * to drain from the first pg-boss poll at boot — on a heavy tenant that meant
 * several full-history loads contending for the connection pool at once (a boot
 * storm / crash-loop risk). Each type now gets an increasing
 * `BOOT_BACKFILL_STAGGER_SECONDS` multiple as a `startAfter` delay so their
 * loads spread across a window instead of all landing on the same poll. Dense
 * intra-day retention keeps its own larger boot defer (the established P2028
