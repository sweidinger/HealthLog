/**
 * v1.26.0 — pg-boss queue + boot-time self-converging backfill for newly
 * connected Google Health accounts. Modelled on the Fitbit / WHOOP backfill
 * (`src/lib/jobs/fitbit-backfill.ts`): a discovery query enqueues one job per
 * connection that has NOT yet been backfilled, and the pass is idempotent
 * across reboots (the predicate `backfill_completed_at IS NULL` drops a
 * connection once its backfill finishes).
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder/register-integration-sync.ts` or pg-boss never
 * provisions it and the boot enqueue silently never drains (the v1.4.37
 * dead-queue class).
