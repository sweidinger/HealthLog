/**
 * v1.4.46 — hourly cron that gives a forgotten medication dose a terminal
 * state. Without it the dashboard "compliance" tile keeps counting a never-
 * acted dose as `pending` forever (the row's `takenAt` stays NULL), which
 * prevents the next day's intake from rendering cleanly in the "today"
 * window.
 *
 * v1.15.9 — the terminal state is now `auto_missed = true`, NOT
 * `skipped = true`. A forgotten dose is a real MISS — it must count against
 * adherence. The old behaviour flipped `skipped = true`, and because the
 * compliance engine EXCLUDES skipped doses from the denominator (a
 * deliberate user pause), a forgotten dose then vanished from the rate
 * entirely, silently inflating adherence. Setting `auto_missed` keeps the
 * never-acted dose distinct from a user-initiated skip: the engine pairs an
 * `auto_missed` slot to a `missed` status (counts against the rate) while a
 * `skipped` row stays excluded (a deliberate drug holiday).
 *
 * v1.15.20 — the cutoff is cadence-aware instead of a flat 24 h. The band
 * model gives a day-scale cadence (weekly / rolling injectables) an overdue
 * tail of `weeklyOnTimeDays + weeklyOverdueDays` (5 days by default — the
 * clinical 4-day rule plus the ±1-day on-time band), so stamping the miss
 * 24 h after the anchor contradicted the dose-history ledger, which still
 * showed the slot as takeable. The pass now derives ONE conservative
 * auto-miss delay per medication from its schedule family (no per-row band
 * mint): `cutoff = scheduledFor + on-time reach + overdue reach` of the
 * family, floored at the legacy 24 h grace. The same pass also restricts
 * the flip to live rows (`deletedAt: null` — a tombstoned row must never be
 * resurrected as a miss) and bumps `syncVersion` so sync clients see the
 * transition.
 *
 * Rule: set `auto_missed = true` for every live `MedicationIntakeEvent`
 * where:
 *   * `skipped = false` AND
 *   * `auto_missed = false` AND
 *   * `takenAt IS NULL` AND
 *   * `deletedAt IS NULL` AND
 *   * `scheduledFor < NOW() - <per-medication auto-miss delay>`
 *
 * The 24 h floor is intentional: a slightly late mark (user took the
 * morning dose at noon when the schedule was 09:00) shouldn't be flipped
 * before the user has had a full day to record it.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: the second pass within the same hour finds
 * zero candidate rows because the first pass already flipped them. Safe to
 * re-run on worker restart.
 *
 * Compliance coupling: the engine-backed compliance paths read `auto_missed`
 * directly. The helper deliberately does NOT touch any rollup — the next
 * read-path call recomputes from the live rows.
