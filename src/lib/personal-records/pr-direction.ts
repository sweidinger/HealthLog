/**
 * MeasurementType → PersonalRecordDirection resolver.
 *
 * Stored vocabulary is `MAX` (higher is the record) or `MIN` (lower is
 * the record). A `null` return value means "this metric does not have
 * a PersonalRecord" — the future detection worker short-circuits on
 * those types so it never writes a row that has ambiguous semantics.
 *
 * Buckets (full rationale in W8d implementation outline §5):
 *
 *   MAX direction:
 *     * Activity & daylight — more is the achievement.
 *     * VO2 max, HRV, fat-free / muscle mass, total body water,
 *       bone mass — biomarkers where a higher value is the goal.
 *
 *   MIN direction:
 *     * Resting heart rate — lower = better cardiovascular fitness.
 *     * Body fat, fat mass, visceral fat — composition metrics
 *       where lower is the goal.
 *     * Vascular age, pulse-wave velocity — lower = healthier
 *       arteries.
 *     * Audio exposure — lower = less hearing damage. The "record"
 *       is the quietest day (kept here for symmetry; the detection
 *       worker can still flag a too-loud day separately).
 *
 *   null (no PR):
 *     * Blood pressure (high reading isn't an achievement; low can
 *       also be clinically bad), blood glucose (extremes both ways),
 *       body & skin temperature (homeostatic, not a goal), pulse
 *       (spot-reading), oxygen saturation (homeostatic), weight
 *       (direction is user-goal-dependent — to defer until the
 *       v1.4.26 worker can read User.thresholdsJson), sleep duration
 *       (longer is not strictly better), fat-free mass when treated
 *       as a derived (weight − fat) value with the same ambiguity.
 *
 * Adding a new MeasurementType: extend the switch below. The
 * drift-guard test in `__tests__/pr-direction.test.ts` asserts every
 * canonical enum value lands in exactly one branch.
