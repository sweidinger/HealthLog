/**
 * v1.30.3 (QA F4) — one-shot repair for the `PersonalRecord` rows the
 * pre-fix cumulative-day picker double-counted.
 *
 * Background: before `8902d3985` (v1.29.6), `findBestCumulativeDay`
 * (`pr-detection-worker.ts`) summed EVERY row on a calendar day regardless
 * of source — a day with both an Apple Health AND a Withings write for the
 * same cumulative metric (steps, active energy, flights, distance,
 * daylight, falls) summed both sources into one inflated total and wrote
 * it as the all-time "best". The fix (source-collapse via
 * `pickCanonicalSourceRows` before summing) stops the inflation going
 * forward, but the worker's improvement gate only ever compares a
 * freshly-computed day against the STORED best — an already-inflated
 * stored row can never be beaten again, so the false record silently
 * outranks every honest day forever (PR list, digest milestone, doctor
 * report), and the affected user can never set a genuine record on that
 * metric again.
 *
 * This job deletes the suspect rows (measurement-driven — `metricSlot`
 * null — one of `CUMULATIVE_HK_TYPES`, created BEFORE the fix landed) and
 * immediately re-runs detection for the affected user with `silent: true`
 * so the (already-fixed) worker inserts the honest re-derived best without
 * firing a "new record" push for what is data hygiene, not an achievement.
 *
 * Converges to zero without a marker column: the cutoff is the fixed
 * instant the source-collapse fix went live upstream (safely after the
 * `8902d3985` merge). Any row created before it predates the bug fix and
 * is suspect; any row this job (or the ordinary worker) writes going
 * forward is always created after that instant, so it can never re-match
 * the discovery predicate. A re-run (reboot mid-walk, or an install that
 * upgrades straight past this release) simply finds fewer/no affected
 * users each time.
 *
 * The queue name MUST be registered in `allQueues` in
 * `src/lib/jobs/reminder/register-rollup.ts` or pg-boss never provisions
 * it and the boot enqueue silently never drains (the v1.4.37 dead-queue
 * class).
