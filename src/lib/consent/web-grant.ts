/**
 * v1.16.13 — web AI-consent receipt minting.
 *
 * The `ConsentReceipt` gate (`src/lib/ai/consent-guard.ts`, shipped in
 * commit 37e9f32f) requires an active receipt before any health snapshot
 * egresses via the operator's server-managed OpenAI key (`admin-openai`).
 * iOS mints an `ai_full` receipt on consent grant + once per shell mount
 * to heal existing accounts. The web client never minted one, so web users
 * on a shared-key deployment saw the fail-closed no-key fallback on every
 * AI surface.
 *
 * This helper closes that gap: it mints an `ai_full` receipt for the web
 * user when none is active, mirroring the iOS master-grant pattern. It is
 * idempotent — a user with an active `ai_full` receipt is a no-op, so it is
 * safe to call on every AI-settings mount (the web equivalent of the iOS
 * shell-mount heal). Explicit revocation flows through the existing
 * `DELETE /api/consent/ai/latest`; this helper only ever grants.
 *
 * The artefact is a small JSON record of the web grant context (no signed
 * PDF/JWT — the web grant is an in-app affirmative action recorded with its
 * timestamp + source, which is the GDPR Art. 7 audit signal the legal team
 * needs). It stays well under the 64 KB artefact cap.
