/**
 * v1.18.6 — citation-backed reference-range backbone.
 *
 * A single structured source of truth for the population reference bands
 * the UI surfaces (explainer captions, metric tiles, the glossary, the
 * "where your value sits" tooltip). Each metric carries:
 *   - the canonical display unit,
 *   - one or more named `bands` (low/high half-open, with the body + year
 *     that publishes them via a `CitationId`),
 *   - the primary `referenceId` (the body the headline band is sourced to),
 *   - an optional `conflicts[]` of alternative-guideline context (e.g. the
 *     BP US/EU disagreement — shown as placement context, never the
 *     shipped classification),
 *   - a `guidanceCaveat` that frames the band as general guidance.
 *
 * This module is intentionally read-only data + pure helpers — no DB, no
 * LLM, no per-user state. The metric-status registry fills its coarse
 * `normalRange` from these bands; the BP detail surface reads the PP / MAP
 * anchors; the explainers read `referenceLabel()` for the cited sentence.
 *
 * Every band traces to `src/lib/medical-citations.ts`. No commercial brand
 * is named anywhere. Ranges are population anchors that shift with age,
 * sex and condition — the user's own baseline always leads the read; these
 * are a placement aid, not a diagnosis. Where authoritative bodies
 * disagree the disagreement is surfaced (`conflicts`), never silently
 * resolved.
