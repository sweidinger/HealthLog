/**
 * Custom `undici.Agent` that resolves the request hostname literally,
 * vets every returned address against `isPublicIp`, and pins the
 * connection to the vetted survivor set.
 *
 * This closes the DNS-rebinding gap that `isPublicUrl` cannot reach
 * (issue #217). The input-time check accepts a hostname that resolves
 * to a public address; the resolver is then free to flip the record to
 * `169.254.169.254` (cloud metadata) or `10.0.0.x` (operator admin
 * panel) by the time the connection dials. With a TTL of 0 the attack
 * is reliable.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *
 *  1. Override `connect.lookup` with a wrapper that always runs
 *     `dns.lookup({ all: true })` so we see every address the resolver
 *     would have returned.
 *  2. Filter that list through `isPublicIp` — same allowlist
 *     `isPublicUrl` enforces, applied to a literal IP address rather
 *     than the input string.
 *  3. Hand undici the FULL vetted survivor set, not just the first
 *     address. The `Agent` runs with `autoSelectFamily`, so undici's
 *     connector calls this lookup with `all: true` and then performs
 *     RFC 8305 Happy Eyeballs across the survivors. Returning only the
 *     first address — historically `allowed[0]` — defeated that: a host
 *     whose first record is an unreachable IPv6 (common on a no-IPv6
 *     container / LAN / Tailscale path, e.g. `claude.ai` from a v4-only
 *     box) failed the connect instantly even though a working IPv4
 *     record was right behind it. Every IP undici may dial was vetted in
 *     THIS lookup, so DNS rebinding stays closed while v4/v6 fallback
 *     works.
 *  4. If no address passes, fail closed with `dns.NOTFOUND` so the
 *     dispatch surfaces as a normal connect error rather than a silent
 *     bypass.
 *
 * Wired into `safeFetch` only when `opts.requirePublicHost` is true.
 * The outbound paths that accept a user-supplied host all use that flag.
