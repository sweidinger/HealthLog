/**
 * v1.4.25 W5e — per-user, per-metric-class source priority. When more
 * than one ingest source ships the same metric for the same day, the
 * analytics aggregator consults this map to pick ONE canonical source
 * per day (so cumulative metrics like steps don't double-count) or to
 * pick a "display preferred" source (for point measurements like weight
 * or BP — every source's row stays in the DB as an audit trail).
 *
 * Today (v1.4.25) only WITHINGS + MANUAL exist for any of these
 * metrics, so the function effectively no-ops for every user. The
 * shape lands now so v1.5's Apple Health passthrough drops onto a
 * known foundation without extra schema work.
 *
 * Persisted as `User.sourcePriorityJson` (nullable Jsonb). Null = use
 * `DEFAULT_SOURCE_PRIORITY` verbatim.
 *
 * v1.4.25 W8c — two-axis extension. The original (W5e) shape carried a
 * per-metric ladder at the top level (e.g. `weight: ["WITHINGS", …]`).
 * W8c adds two optional containers ON TOP of that:
 *   - `metricPriority`     — the per-metric ladder, identical in shape
 *                            to the top-level keys but nested. The
 *                            nested form is canonical going forward;
 *                            the flat form is kept as a backward-compat
 *                            shim (no migration / no UI for it).
 *   - `deviceTypePriority` — within a source, which device wins. Keyed
 *                            by metric type with an optional `default`
 *                            ladder that covers metrics where the user
 *                            hasn't set a per-metric override.
 *
 * Both new keys are optional; existing rows with the flat shape keep
 * working unchanged. `parseSourcePriority()` merges everything onto
 * `DEFAULT_SOURCE_PRIORITY` plus an empty two-axis state so the call
 * site never has to think about which keys exist.
