/**
 * v1.21.3 (B1) — request schemas for the Coach goal / if-then plan surface
 * (`/api/coach/plans` + `/api/coach/plans/[id]`).
 *
 * Lives outside the route files so the OpenAPI registry can import it without
 * touching the route modules (route files may only export handlers + config)
 * and without dragging the Prisma-backed helper module into the generator
 * script.
 *
 * No `userId` field anywhere — the owner is always narrowed from the session.
 * The extractor is the only writer of plan TEXT; this surface only lets the
 * user CONFIRM (proposed → active), mark a plan met / abandoned, set a review
 * date, or soft-delete. It never accepts the encrypted free-text fields, so a
 * client can never inject or overwrite a plan's prose.
