 * Lives outside the route file so the OpenAPI registry can import it
 * without dragging `@/lib/db` into the generator script — the same
 * split as `src/lib/validations/invite.ts`.
 *
 * The endpoint appends a MANUAL schedule era ("the medication dosed at
 * 07:00/19:00 from March to June, before I tracked it here"). The body
 * carries the era bounds as instants plus the daily times-of-day the
 * era dosed at; the route derives the snapshot payload entry
 * (`FREQ=DAILY`, window pulled to min/max of the times) so the era
 * minter reads it exactly like a write-path archive.
