/**
 * v1.18.0 — module enable/disable request validation.
 *
 * The PATCH body is a partial map of TOGGLEABLE module keys → boolean.
 * Only keys in the canonical registry (`MODULE_KEYS`) are accepted; a
 * core-domain key (`weight`, `bloodPressure`, `pulse`) or any unknown key
 * is a 422 — so the core measurement engine can never be disabled through
 * this surface (defence-in-depth on top of the gate, which has no key to
 * flip for core domains anyway). v1.18.1 (D3) — `medications` graduated to
 * a toggleable module, so it IS writable here now.
 *
 * `strict()` rejects unknown keys outright rather than silently dropping
 * them, so a client gets a clear error instead of a no-op.
 *
 * Delegated keys (`cycle`, `coach`) are NOT accepted here: their
 * enabled-state is owned elsewhere (the cycle gate / `disableCoach` + the
 * operator assistant flag), so a value for them would land inert in
 * `modulePreferencesJson` and mislead — the Modules hub renders them as
 * read-only "managed in X" rows that deep-link to the real control. Omitting
 * them from the schema means a stale client sending `{ coach: false }` gets
 * a clear 422 instead of a silent no-op behind a green "saved" toast.
 *
 * The shared shape is reused by the OpenAPI registry so the wire
 * contract stays single-source.
