 * evidence disclosure closed by default). The Coach prompt builder +
 * snapshot builder both read this shape — the snapshot must filter on
 * `excludeMetrics` BEFORE landing in the system prompt so the model
 * never sees data the user opted out of.
 *
 * v1.4.25 W5 — extended with `defaultWindow`. The picker lives in the
 * settings sheet; the drawer header carries a per-conversation override
 * pill so a single chat can narrow the window without flipping the
 * global default. The chat route folds the saved preference into the
 * snapshot scope when the client didn't supply a window override.
