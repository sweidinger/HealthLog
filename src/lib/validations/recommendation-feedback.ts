 * v1.4.16 phase B5e — request body for `POST /api/insights/feedback`.
 *
 * Mirrors the `RecommendationFeedback` Prisma model fields the client
 * is allowed to specify. `providerType` and `promptVersion` are NOT
 * part of the request shape — the server fills them from the user's
 * most recent cached payload + the current PROMPT_VERSION constant
 * so the client can't tamper with the attribution that the daily
 * aggregator slices on for the admin AI quality dashboard.
 *
 * Severity + dataWindow are constrained to the same vocabulary as the
 * AI schema (`aiRecommendationSchema` / `aiRecommendationRationaleSchema`)
 * so a bogus rating attempt with `severity = "wat"` is rejected at the
 * edge instead of poisoning the aggregator.
