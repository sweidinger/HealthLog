/**
 * v1.30.9 — client-safe pure helpers shared by the dashboard's batched
 * chart-series read on BOTH sides of the render boundary.
 *
 * The dashboard fetches every visible non-sleep chart series in ONE batched
 * request keyed by `queryKeys.chartSeriesBatch(typesCsv, fromIso, toIso)`.
 * The RSC (`src/app/page.tsx`) prefetches that same batch into the dehydrated
 * TanStack cache; the client (`src/app/page-client.tsx`) reads it back on
 * mount. For the prefetch to land (not silently no-op into a client refetch)
 * the server-built key must be byte-identical to the client-built key.
 *
 * The key has two moving parts — the CSV type list and the ISO window — and
 * this module is the SINGLE source of truth for both, so server and client
 * cannot drift:
 *
 *  - `deriveBatchChartTypes(layout, summaries)` — both sides call this over the
 *    SAME snapshot payload (the server dehydrates the very snapshot the client
 *    reads), so the ordered type list, and therefore the CSV, is identical by
 *    construction.
 *  - `computeBatchWindow(now, timezone)` — the server computes the window ONCE
 *    from the profile timezone and threads it to the client as an RSC prop
 *    (`batchWindow`). The client adopts the prop verbatim, so no independent
 *    browser-vs-container computation can disagree by a millisecond or a zone.
 *    `computeLocalBatchWindow()` is the browser-local fallback for the
 *    prefetch-off / legacy / fail-soft paths where no prop arrives.
 *
 * Import-safe from the server RSC and the client component alike: pure, no
 * Prisma / db / `node:*` imports (only the client-safe `@/lib/tz/format`
 * Intl helpers and the layout type).
