/**
 * v1.21.2 (A5 / A6) — the score-card narrative block for the dashboard /
 * insights hero.
 *
 * Two server-resolved, DTO-only signals the `HealthScoreCard` renders but never
 * recomputes:
 *
 *   - `tension` (A5) — the honest "internal read" when the readiness composite's
 *     contributors DISAGREE (good sleep but a rising resting pulse, …). Reuses
 *     the SAME readiness components the wellness ring grades + the SAME
 *     `deriveTension` disagreement detector the Coach snapshot uses, so the card
 *     and the Coach never narrate two different verdicts. Clinical-floors
 *     override: when a real clinical red-flag is in play (the coincident-
 *     deviation flag fired WITHOUT an illness explanation) the tension is
 *     SUPPRESSED (`null`) so the red-flag path dominates — a red-flag is never
 *     reconciled away into a calm verdict.
 *
 *   - `returnToBand` (A6) — present only when a salient metric has come BACK
 *     inside the user's OWN personal range after a prior out-of-band run. Runs
 *     the pure `detectStreak` engine across the salient vitals and surfaces AT
 *     MOST ONE (the most salient return). Actively closes a worry rather than
 *     reporting a number.
 *
 * Both omit (return `null`) rather than guess: tension stays quiet on a coherent
 * day, `returnToBand` requires a genuine prior out-of-band run. The block is
 * LOCALE-AGNOSTIC — it emits contributor KEYS + a metric TYPE; the client
 * localises them through the existing readiness-contributor + metric-name i18n
 * keys before handing the card its already-localised strings. iOS rides the same
 * DTO and resolves its own labels.
 *
 * Server-only — reads `@/lib/db` transitively through the derived engines.
