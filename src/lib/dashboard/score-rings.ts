/**
 * v1.27.7 — hero score-ring resolution for the dashboard snapshot.
 *
 * Resolves the user-selected `selectedScoreRings` (max 3, closed
 * `SCORE_RING_IDS` set) into ring entries the hero renders next to the
 * health-score ring:
 *
 *   - `READINESS` / `RECOVERY_SCORE` / `SLEEP_SCORE` call the SAME
 *     `computeDerivedMetric` dispatcher the `/api/insights/derived`
 *     batch route uses (profile loaded once via the shared
 *     `loadBaselineProfile`) — no score logic is re-derived here, and a
 *     non-`ok` compute (insufficient data, engine gate) simply yields no
 *     ring, mirroring the wellness strip's self-gating.
 *   - `MED_COMPLIANCE` is TODAY's dose progress from the snapshot's own
 *     `medsToday` block (takenToday / scheduledToday) — the same numbers
 *     the old hero dose row carried and the native client shows. The
 *     v1.27.7 first cut showed the pooled 7-day adherence percentage
 *     here; a percentage on a ring next to "today" scores read as a
 *     mystery number, so the ring now answers the question the hero
 *     actually poses: how many of today's doses are done. `score` stays
 *     the 0..100 progress (rounded) for wire compatibility; the additive
 *     `doses` field carries the taken/scheduled pair for the "1/3"
 *     display. No doses scheduled today → no ring (self-gating). The
 *     band is progress semantics — `green` once every scheduled dose is
 *     taken, `yellow` while doses remain — never `red`: pending doses in
 *     the morning are not an alert state.
 *
 * Module gating rides the client-safe `SCORE_RING_MODULE` map in
 * `@/lib/dashboard-layout` (mirroring the derived routes'
 * `DERIVED_MODULE`: readiness/recovery → recovery module, sleep score →
 * sleep module, MED_COMPLIANCE → medications) plus the `insights` gate
 * every derived read sits behind.
 *
 * Every ring resolves fail-soft: a throwing engine drops its ring, never
 * the snapshot.
