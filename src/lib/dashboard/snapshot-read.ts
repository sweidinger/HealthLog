/**
 * Shared cached-snapshot read for the two dashboard entry points:
 *
 *   - `GET /api/dashboard/snapshot` (the client cell's endpoint), and
 *   - the dashboard RSC wrapper (`src/app/page.tsx`), which server-
 *     prefetches the same payload into a dehydrated TanStack cache so the
 *     first HTML paints real tiles instead of skeletons-until-JS.
 *
 * Both ride the SAME `caches.analytics` SWR cell (key
 * `${userId}|dashboard-snapshot|${locale}`), so an RSC prefetch warms the
 * API path and vice versa — the builder never runs twice for one user
 * within the TTL, and the write-invalidation semantics (stale-sweep on
 * measurement writes, hard evict on widget reorder) cover both readers.
