/**
 * v1.7.0 W6 — unified dashboard first-paint snapshot.
 *
 * `buildDashboardSnapshot` assembles every above-the-fold tile field in
 * a single server round-trip from the existing rollup / mood / widget
 * helpers plus a read-only lift of the pre-generated daily briefing.
 * The whole strip therefore shares one completion moment instead of the
 * legacy four-cell waterfall (slim analytics + thick analytics + mood +
 * widget layout, each gated behind `/api/auth/me`).
 *
 * Two-phase shape — the deliberate trade-off documented in the
 * R-firstpaint spec §6 "Risks":
 *
 *   - `tiles` — fast, ALWAYS present. The slim summaries slice, the
 *     mood block, the resolved widget layout, the derived user profile
 *     fields. These resolve sub-second on a warm rollup tenant.
 *   - `extras` — thick, MAY be null. The BD-Zielbereich (`bpInTargetPct*`)
 *     and per-context glucose tiles ride the slowest reads (the
 *     `computeBpInTargetFastPath` fast-path falls back to multi-second
 *     live SQL on a rollup-coverage miss). Collapsing them into the
 *     fast phase would make the WHOLE strip wait for the slowest
 *     sub-query. Instead the builder runs both phases concurrently
 *     inside one `Promise.all`; on a coverage miss `extras` is emitted
 *     `null` so the BD/glucose tiles fall back to a per-tile shimmer
 *     while every other tile paints together. Warm-rollup tenants get
 *     everything in the single payload because the thick reads resolve
 *     inside the same fast window.
 *
 * No LLM is reachable from this builder. The briefing is lifted
 * read-only from `User.insightsCachedText`; a cache miss / stale row
 * yields `briefingState: "preparing"` (with the last good briefing
 * delivered under `briefingStale: true` when one exists) and the
 * `insight-pregenerate` cron refills it — or `"no-provider"` when no
 * AI provider is configured anywhere, so clients can stop waiting.
 * The builder NEVER POSTs `/api/insights/generate`.
