  // v1.4.25 W16c — PR detection. Default OFF (see DEFAULT_EVENT_PREFS
  // below) so a multi-year Apple Health backfill doesn't fire hundreds
  // of pushes during initial sync.
  "PERSONAL_RECORD",
  // v0.5.4 ios-coord — daily mood-reminder nudge. Default OFF on the
  // per-event policy (see DEFAULT_EVENT_PREFS) and additionally gated
  // on the per-user `moodReminderEnabled` flag, so a user has to opt
  // in twice before the server starts nudging them about an
  // emotionally-loaded surface.
  "MOOD_REMINDER",
  // v1.15 — cycle reminders. Both default OFF (see EVENT_DEFAULT_ENABLED)
  // and are gated again on `CycleProfile.cycleTrackingEnabled`, so a user
  // opts in twice before the server nudges about an intent-revealing,
  // privacy-sensitive surface. `CYCLE_PERIOD_SOON` fires a couple of days
  // before the predicted next-period start; `CYCLE_PERIOD_CONFIRM` is a
  // gentle "did your period start?" on/after the predicted start while no
  // period is logged. When `CycleProfile.discreetNotifications` is true the
  // push body is the generic "HealthLog reminder" so no cycle event is
  // named on the lock screen.
  "CYCLE_PERIOD_SOON",
  "CYCLE_PERIOD_CONFIRM",
  // v1.15.1 — fertile-window reminder. Default OFF (see EVENT_DEFAULT_ENABLED)
  // and TTC-gated in the cron: it only fires when `CycleProfile.goal ===
  // "TRYING_TO_CONCEIVE"`, so fertile language never reaches the
  // AVOID_PREGNANCY / GENERAL_HEALTH / PERIMENOPAUSE goals (the inclusive-
  // framing rule). Fires a few days before `CyclePrediction.fertileWindowStart`
  // and honours discreet mode like the other cycle reminders.
  "CYCLE_FERTILE_SOON",
  // v1.15.20 — proactive Coach nudge. Fired by the 05:15 Europe/Berlin
  // cron when a deterministic trigger (7-day compliance < 60 %, BP
  // weekly mean above target, sharply falling recovery score) warrants
  // pointing the user at /insights/coach. Capped at one nudge per user
  // per rolling week via the `push_attempts` ledger; per-user opt-out
  // lives in `notificationPrefs.coach.nudgesEnabled`.
  "COACH_NUDGE",
  // v1.16.11 — medication low-stock alert. Fired by the daily
  // medication-low-stock cron when a medication with tracked inventory
  // projects fewer remaining-supply days than the user's per-user
  // runway threshold (default 7 days, OFF possible). One notification
  // per threshold crossing; the stamp on the medication row re-arms on
  // refill or threshold change. ON at the channel layer — the real
  // gate is the per-user threshold in `notificationPrefs.medication`.
  "MEDICATION_LOW_STOCK",
  // v1.17.1 — Vorsorge (measurement / preventive-care) reminder. Fired by
  // the every-15-min measurement-reminder cron when a user-created
  // reminder ("measure BP every 7 days", "annual blood panel") is due
  // inside the user's local notify-hour window. ON by default at the
  // channel layer (see EVENT_DEFAULT_ENABLED): these are reminders the
  // user explicitly created, so silence-by-default would be surprising.
  // The real gate is the per-reminder `enabled` flag plus the per-user
  // `notificationPrefs.measurementReminder.clientManaged` suppression.
  // NOT time-sensitive — a Vorsorge nudge is not a Focus-bypass case.
  "MEASUREMENT_REMINDER",
  // v1.17.1 (#22) — silent medication-intake cross-device sync. Fired on a
  // medication-intake mutation (single + bulk) to the user's OTHER iOS
  // devices so a Live Activity / Home-Screen widget reconciles after a dose
  // is logged on one device. APNs-ONLY by construction: it is a silent
  // `apns-push-type: background` push (content-available, no alert) and has
  // no Telegram / ntfy / Web Push semantics, so it never fans out to those
  // channels (the dispatcher would have nothing meaningful to deliver and a
  // user-visible Telegram message on every dose would be noise). Routed
  // through the dedicated intake-sync sender, not the alert cascade.
