/**
 * Notification dispatcher retry policy (v1.4.15 Phase B3).
 *
 * Two failure classes:
 *  - HARD reject (`hardReject: true`)        → channel is dead, do NOT retry,
 *    auto-disable immediately and capture a `disabledReason` so the UI can
 *    explain *why* the user needs to re-pair.
 *  - SOFT reject (`hardReject: false`)       → upstream temporarily unhappy
 *    (network timeout, 5xx, 429, generic fetch failure). Retry per the
 *    backoff schedule and only auto-disable after `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`
 *    in a row (5).
 *
 * Hard-reject signal mapping (per spec):
 *  - Web-Push   : statusCode 410 (FCM/Mozilla "subscription gone")
 *  - Web-Push   : statusCode 404 (subscription endpoint deleted) — already
 *                 deletes the row in the sender; treated as hard at the
 *                 channel level only when ALL subs were 410/404 (i.e. the
 *                 channel can no longer succeed).
 *  - Telegram   : Bot API description "chat not found" or
 *                 "Forbidden: bot was blocked by the user"
 *  - ntfy       : statusCode 410 (topic invalidated)
 *
 * Soft-reject signal mapping:
 *  - Any HTTP 5xx, HTTP 429, fetch network error / timeout, generic non-OK
 *    response that doesn't match the hard-reject rules.
