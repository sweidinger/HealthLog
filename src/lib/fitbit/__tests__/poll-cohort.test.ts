/**
 * v1.12.1 — `runFitbitPollCohort` bounded-concurrency + per-user isolation.
 *
 * The hourly Fitbit cron carries no `userId`, so the worker resolves every
 * connection and hands the cohort to `runFitbitPollCohort`. These tests pin the
 * contract that matters for a growing cohort:
 *   - the pool never runs more than `concurrency` users at once (one slow
 *     Google response can't stall the whole pass — the others proceed);
 *   - a single user's failure is isolated (reported, not thrown) and the rest
 *     of the cohort still syncs;
 *   - the per-cohort totals add up across the pool.
