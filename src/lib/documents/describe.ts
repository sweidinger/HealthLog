/**
 * v1.27.22 (Document vault P2) — on-demand, session-only document description.
 *
 * Two single-call provider passes over a stored document (or browser-OCR text):
 *   - `runDocumentSummary` → a short plain-language summary of WHAT the document
 *     is. Descriptive only — explicitly forbidden from diagnosing, interpreting,
 *     or advising (interpretation boundary G7).
 *   - `transcribeDocument` → the raw verbatim text. Also reused to build the
 *     content-search index text from a vision provider.
 *
 * Both are session-only at the route layer (P2-D4): nothing here persists. The
 * document is UNTRUSTED DATA to be described, never instructions (prompt-
 * injection framing copied from `extract.ts`).
