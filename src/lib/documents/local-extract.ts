/**
 * Local (provider-free) text extraction for the document vault.
 *
 * When NO AI provider is configured — or the user has not consented to one —
 * content search still needs a baseline. This module extracts a PDF's embedded
 * text layer SERVER-SIDE with `pdf-parse` (already a direct dependency; its
 * `getText()` touches only the pure-JS/wasm pdfjs core, never the native
 * `@napi-rs/canvas`), in milliseconds, with no OCR and no third-party egress.
 * The extracted text feeds the SAME blind, encrypted content index the provider
 * path writes (`upsertContentIndex`), so nothing readable is stored at rest.
 *
 * Digitally-generated PDFs (lab reports, discharge letters, referrals — the
 * clinical common case) carry a real embedded text layer this path reads.
 * Scanned/image-only PDFs and uploaded images have NO text layer: local OCR
 * (server-side tesseract + `deu+eng` traineddata baked into the image, plus
 * `@napi-rs/canvas` rasterisation for scanned PDFs) is a deferred follow-up, NOT
 * built here — it carries the only real Alpine/standalone-tracing + CPU cost.
 * Until it lands, those documents stay un-indexed on the local path and are
 * covered by the provider (vision) path whenever one is configured.
