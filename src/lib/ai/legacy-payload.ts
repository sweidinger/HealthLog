/**
 * v1.4.16 phase B5c — legacy-payload detection.
 *
 * Cached insight blobs persisted before B5c shipped don't carry the
 * `rationale` field. The /api/insights/generate route surfaces a
 * `legacyPayload: true` flag on cache-hit so the UI can render a
 * "Insights updated — regenerate for new explainability features"
 * CTA. User-initiated regeneration stays the trigger; we do NOT
 * auto-regenerate on cache-hit (that would burn rate-limit tokens
 * silently and surprise users who explicitly toggled cache-only).
 *
 * Detection is lenient on purpose: the cached payload may carry
 * either the canonical `AIInsightResponse` shape (structured recs)
 * or the legacy `InsightResult` shape (string-only recommendations).
 * Both predate B5c rationale; both flag.
 */

/**
 * Returns true when the payload predates the v1.4.16 strict insight
 * shape and the UI must surface the regenerate CTA instead of trying
 * to render the rich card.
 *
 * Detection branches:
 * - Non-object / null / undefined input → false (nothing to migrate).
 * - **v1.4.14 pre-strict shape** (`{changed, stable, drivers, ...}` —
 *   no `summary`, no `recommendations[]`, no `findings[]`): true. This
 *   is the production crash the maintainer hit on 2026-05-10 — the route's
 *   `safeParse` failed against `insightResultSchema`, fell through to
 *   the raw blob, and the rich card called `.replace()` on
 *   `undefined`. Detect by absence of *both* `summary` (string) and
 *   `recommendations` (array).
 * - **v1.4.15 mid-shape** (recommendations[] present, all strings):
 *   true (plain-string recs predate B5c rationale).
 * - **v1.4.16 pre-B5c shape** (recommendations[] present, structured,
 *   missing `rationale`): true.
 * - Otherwise → false.
