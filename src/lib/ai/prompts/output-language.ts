/**
 * Output-language resolution for the assessment prompt family.
 *
 * The problem this solves: the prompt modules historically branched
 * `locale === "en" ? EN_BODY : DE_BODY`. That binary is correct for a de/en
 * product, but HealthLog ships six UI locales — so every fr/es/it/pl reader
 * fell to the GERMAN instruction body, whose output clause explicitly asks for
 * a German assessment. A French account therefore received German prose (on
 * the surfaces that reached the prompts at all).
 *
 * The fix keeps ONE instruction body per prompt in the two languages that have
 * a reviewed body (de, en) and names the reader's language in an explicit
 * directive, rather than growing four more hand-maintained translations of
 * every prompt. The directive text itself is NOT invented here: it is the
 * `reply_language_directive` from `safety-contracts.<locale>.yaml`, written
 * natively per locale and already carried in production by the native
 * insights/briefing prompts (`native-prompts.ts:338,507`). This module only
 * makes that same mechanism reachable from the assessment family.
 *
 * Polarity matters and is the whole point: the fallback for an unknown or
 * non-German locale is ENGLISH, never German. `instructionLocale` is the
 * single replacement for every scattered de-default binary.
