/**
 * v1.4.36 W3 T4 — `compactSections` helper for the AI prompt body.
 *
 * The features payload (and the Coach snapshot, transitively) carries
 * conditionally-populated blocks: `medications`, `bucketedMeasurements`,
 * `historicalComparison`, the per-metric aggregates, etc. Empty blocks
 * have two failure modes once they hit the prompt:
 *
 *   1. The serialised JSON includes a labelled-empty key (`"sleep": []`
 *      or `"medications": []`) which the model occasionally narrates as
 *      "there are no medications in your data" even when the user
 *      explicitly excluded them — wasted prompt budget and a misleading
 *      framing.
 *   2. Some downstream prose composers render the block label without
 *      checking row count, producing the v1.4.35 "Hier sind die
 *      Schlafdaten: [keine]" anti-pattern the maintainer flagged in W3.
 *
 * `compactSections` walks the object once and drops any property whose
 * value is:
 *   - an empty array
 *   - an empty object (no own enumerable keys)
 *   - undefined
 *
 * It runs a single shallow pass at the top level — that's enough for
 * the features + snapshot shapes today. We do NOT recurse into nested
 * objects because the legitimate empty values inside e.g.
 * `coverage: { count: 0, … }` should stay readable (count 0 IS the
 * signal). A future call site that needs deep-compaction can opt in
 * via the `deep` flag.
