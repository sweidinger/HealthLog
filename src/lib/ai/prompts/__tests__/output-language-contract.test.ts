/**
 * The output-language contract.
 *
 * These tests exist because four of the six locales cannot be eyeballed at
 * review time. They pin the mechanical guarantees — which body a locale
 * composes, that its own language is named, that the locale's own directive is
 * present and last, and that no German leaks into a non-German prompt.
 *
 * What they deliberately do NOT claim: that the model's prose is idiomatic or
 * correct in French, Spanish, Italian or Polish. No offline test can show
 * that. The precedent is the native insights/briefing prompts, which have
 * carried the same directive in production, and the residual risk is covered
 * by a production check, not by this file.
