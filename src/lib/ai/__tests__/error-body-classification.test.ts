/**
 * An upstream error body never reaches the logs verbatim.
 *
 * The provider chain used to put the first 500 characters of whatever the
 * remote returned into a wide-event meta key. That is fine for a terse vendor
 * error and catastrophic for a gateway that echoes the offending request on a
 * 400 — the standard shape for `context_length_exceeded` — because on this path
 * the request is the coach system prompt plus the user's health snapshot.
 *
 * Scrubbing cannot fix this: there is no pattern that distinguishes a person's
 * weight history from any other text. So the body is classified rather than
 * quoted, and these tests pin that no input content survives.
