/**
 * v1.27.13 (Welle J) — the interpretation-context registry.
 *
 * The per-metric assessment prompt used to hand the model a coarse
 * single-edge `normalRange` and the personal baseline, and nothing that says
 * what a value MEANS on a clinical scale. So the prose recited counts and a
 * trend adjective ("slightly rising") without ever placing the value: is a
 * visceral-fat rating of 2.7 good? Where does it sit? What follows?
 *
 * This module is the hand-curated answer: a typed registry mapping a metric to
 * the guideline INTERPRETATION BANDS the knowledge base
 * (`~/Projects/health-knowledge-base`, vendor-blind, guideline-cited) actually
 * carries — band edges, plain labels, a favourable/neutral/caution/unfavourable
 * valence, the direction a good value moves, and a short source tag. Every
 * entry cites the KB file + section it was derived from in a comment; NO
 * threshold is invented. A metric the KB gives no numeric band for has NO
 * entry here — its assessment then stays purely personal-relative (fail-soft),
 * which is the honest posture the KB itself takes for those metrics.
 *
 * The registry feeds two things:
 *   1. `buildInterpretationBlock` (prompts/interpretation-block.ts) renders the
 *      computed band position + table into the per-metric user prompt.
 *   2. `interpretationBandEdges` yields the band-edge numbers so any surface
 *      with a numeric grounding gate can allow-list a quoted guideline
 *      threshold (the v1.25.13 class of bug: an unlisted number strips text).
 *
 * The band position is computed HERE, server-side — never left to the model.
