/**
 * v1.18.10 (HIGH-1 / MEDIUM-3) — Daily-Briefing number-grounding cross-check.
 *
 * The comprehensive-insight schema validates that `dailyBriefing.paragraph`,
 * `signalsOfDay[]` and `keyFindings[]` are well-shaped (non-empty strings,
 * known enums, length caps) — but it does NOT verify that any NUMBER the model
 * restates in those fields traces back to a figure the server pre-computed.
 * `recommendations[]` carry that guarantee (the citation cross-check + retry +
 * 422 in `generate-insight.ts`); the briefing block did not. A model could
 * write "your weight dropped 3 kg this week" while the snapshot's
 * `features.signalsOfDay` says 2 kg, and the payload still passed.
 *
 * This module closes that gap the same way the recommendations gate does:
 * extract every number the briefing prose asserts, and reject the payload when
 * one of them cannot be matched (within a rounding tolerance) to a figure the
 * server itself pre-computed and handed to the model. The caller turns a
 * non-empty finding list into the existing corrective-retry machinery.
 *
 * The authoritative set is derived by WALKING the prompt payload — the whole
 * aggregated-features object plus any extra section the prompt carries — not
 * by re-listing its blocks by hand. That is the same guarantee stated exactly:
 * a number is grounded iff the server gave it to the model. See
 * `authoritativeValues` for why the previous hand-maintained list had to go.
 *
 * Scope + posture:
 *  - The check only fires when `features.signalsOfDay` is present. When the
 *    server pre-computed no signals there is no authoritative number set to
 *    grade against, so the prose is left to the prompt-level grounding rule
 *    (same as before) — we never reject for a number we have nothing to
 *    compare to.
 *  - It grades NUMBERS only. Tone, framing and word choice stay the prompt's
 *    job; this is purely "did the model restate a figure we did not give it".
 *  - Pure + side-effect-free, so it unit-tests in isolation.
