/**
 * v1.18.1 (Workstream C) — Coach cadence suggestions.
 *
 * The Coach can append a `---SUGGEST-REMINDER---` … `---END---` sentinel
 * block to its reply when an evidence-based measurement cadence is worth
 * proposing (a new/changed med, erratic readings, a fast trend, a target
 * off-track, or a measurement gap). The route strips the block out of the
 * prose — exactly like the `---KEYVALUES---` evidence block — parses one
 * cadence id out of it, validates it against the closed CADENCE_CATALOG,
 * and emits an ADDITIVE `suggestion` SSE frame the client renders as a
 * one-tap action card. Accepting the card POSTs to
 * `POST /api/measurement-reminders` with `origin: COACH`; the SERVER
 * resolves the actual cadence (intervalDays / rrule / endsOn) — the model
 * only names the metric + the preset.
 *
 * Why a closed catalog and not free-form cadence fields from the model:
 *   - Evidence-based cadences ONLY. The model picks from a fixed set
 *     grounded in ESH/AHA + general consistency guidance; it cannot mint a
 *     "measure your BP 6×/day" nag.
 *   - Server-authoritative scheduling. The reminder rows are computed by
 *     the same recurrence engine the Vorsorge surface uses; web ↔ iOS read
 *     identical numbers.
 *
 * Defence-in-depth mirrors `keyvalues.ts`: 512-byte cap, one cadence id
 * kept, validated against the catalog, malformed → dropped (no card).

 * A cadence the Coach may propose. `id` is the stable token the model

 *
 * `measurementType` is the auto-resolve target the reminder row carries
 * (the eventful engine advances `lastSatisfiedAt` when a matching reading
 * lands). `module` is the module-gate key that must be enabled for the
 * suggestion to surface — disabled module ⇒ no suggestion.
 *
 * Exactly one of `intervalDays` / `rrule` is set, matching the reminder
 * create contract. `courseDays`, when set, bounds a finite course window
 * (`endsOn = now + courseDays`) for cadences that are deliberately
 * time-boxed (the ESH/AHA 7-day BP protocol).
