/**
 * RECON1 (D5-5) — discovered-driver block for the no-tools Coach snapshot.
 *
 * The FDR-controlled cross-metric driver pairs were reachable ONLY via the
 * `get_correlations` tool, so a local / no-tools provider (Ollama) got the
 * coincident-deviation flag but ZERO discovered drivers — the differentiating
 * cross-metric layer silently degraded, and system-prompt rule 14's fallback
 * clause ("any correlation/driver field the SNAPSHOT carries") pointed at a
 * field that did not exist on the no-tools path.
 *
 * This block closes that gap by attaching a BOUNDED slice of the SAME gated,
 * ranked output the tool serves — `readCoachCorrelations` runs the identical
 * discovery scan + quality gates (effect-size floor, family-tautology
 * exclusion, sample-size shrinkage, confidence tiering), so a local user sees
 * exactly the quality-filtered drivers a cloud user's tool would. We keep only
 * the top few by ranked effect so the no-tools prompt stays compact.
 *
 * Server-only — `readCoachCorrelations` reads `@/lib/db`. Fail-soft: a null
 * return (no surviving driver / read hiccup) attaches nothing.
