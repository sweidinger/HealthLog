 * v1.18.7 — static catalog of the public /learn guides for the Coach.

 * The Coach is article-aware: when a reply would genuinely benefit from a
 * deeper read, it MAY point the user at the matching guide by topic + URL.
 * The article wording itself lives on the public site (docs.healthlog.dev /
 * healthlog.dev/learn) — the Coach never invents article content and may only
 * reference a slug that appears in this catalog, so a fabricated /learn URL is
 * impossible by construction.
 *
 * Keep this list in lock-step with the published guides. The compact prompt
 * injection (`learnCatalogPromptBlock`) groups entries by topic so the model
 * picks the most relevant single link rather than dumping the whole list.
