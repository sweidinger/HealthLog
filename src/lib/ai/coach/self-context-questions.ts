/**
 * v1.16.0 — clarifying questions for the self-context questionnaire.
 *
 * After the user saves Settings → AI → "About me", the server derives
 * up to 3 short follow-up questions that would best complete the
 * picture for the Coach, and persists them encrypted
 * (`UserHealthProfile.pendingQuestionsEncrypted`). The Coach composer
 * renders them as tappable suggestion chips; answering or dismissing a
 * chip removes it.
 *
 * Two paths, gated in order:
 *   1. AI path — only when the user has a working provider
 *      (`hasAnyConfiguredProvider`), an active consent receipt covers
 *      the egress, AND the daily Coach token budget is not exhausted.
 *      One single-shot completion (no fallback chain — this is a
 *      nicety, not a core flow); spend rides the same per-day ledger
 *      the Coach uses.
 *   2. Deterministic path — two static completion hints for the first
 *      two unanswered fields, localised through the server translator.
 *      Also the landing spot for every AI-path failure (no provider,
 *      consent missing, budget gone, model error, unparseable output).
 *
 * The prompt carries the FULL Coach snapshot, so this is a genuine PHI
 * egress and it is gated exactly like every other Coach surface: a chain
 * that could reach the operator's server-managed credential requires an
 * active `ai_coach` / `ai_full` receipt. The gate is SKIP-shaped, not
 * throw-shaped — a missing receipt lands on the deterministic hints, which
 * is what the caller (`PUT /api/coach/about-me`) already expects for every
 * other AI-path miss.
 *
 * Server-only — reads `@/lib/db` through the provider resolver.
