 *   - the v1.17.0 sleep-rhythm summary (sleep-debt + chronotype), built

 * ── v1.7.0 sleep block (with optional per-stage enrichment) ───────

 * Sleep needs the `sleepStage` column so the Coach can narrate REM /
 * core / deep / awake minutes per night instead of a flat duration.
 * The shared `byType("SLEEP_DURATION")` rows already cover the
 * duration timeline, but they drop the stage label — so the sleep
 * branch builds its own block. Per-night stage minutes come from a
 * dedicated read of the SLEEP_DURATION rows that carry a non-null
 * stage; the duration timeline is built from the same rows summed per
 * night (one night = the sum of its per-stage rows).

/**
 * ── v1.17.0 sleep-rhythm block (sleep-debt + chronotype) ──────────
 *
 * The two server-authoritative timing signals the Sleep page + the
 * dashboard summary render — cumulative sleep debt and the MCTQ
 * chronotype band + social jetlag. Built from the SAME assembler the
 * dashboard route uses (`reconstructNights` → `computeSleepRhythmFromNights`),
 * over the rhythm's OWN fixed trailing-42-day rows, so the coach quotes the
 * exact debt + band the page shows regardless of the coach's narration
 * window. ONE ENGINE: this never recomputes sleep-debt or chronotype inline —
 * the math lives in `sleep-debt.ts` / `chronotype.ts`, reached through the
 * assembler. The `needMinutes` is the SAME age-resolved need the derived
 * block + Sleep Score read (`sleepNeedMinutes(ageYears)`), and the
 * `sourcePriorityJson` is the one already loaded for the per-stage sleep
 * block — no extra read beyond the rhythm rows.
 *
 * LEARNING-GATE HONESTY: both signals carry a calm `partial` / `learning`
 * state below their night thresholds. The chronotype `band` is emitted ONLY
 * when the state is `ready` — a learning chronotype is surfaced as
 * "still calibrating", never asserted as a band the data can't support.
