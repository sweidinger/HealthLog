/**
 * Medication-compliance block for the Coach snapshot.
 *
 * Medication compliance lives outside the structured features — the
 * legacy Coach surface labelled it as "general" provenance only.
 * v1.4.20.1 shipped a per-day adherence row; v1.16.9 derives it from
 * the band-engine LEDGER (the same expansion the compliance % and the
 * dose-history view consume): a slot counts against the rate only once
 * it is genuinely missed, a pending/upcoming slot never reads as "not
 * taken", deliberate skips and ad-hoc takes stay out of the
 * denominator, and cross-source duplicate rows collapse onto one slot.
 *
 * Split out of `snapshot.ts`; the builder passes the medication rows it
 * already read plus the shared accumulators, so the emitted shape and
 * ordering are unchanged.
