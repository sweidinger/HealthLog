/**
 * v1.18.11 (#65) — lab-result context block for the Coach snapshot.
 *
 * Lets the Coach answer "what was my LDL last time" / "is my ferritin in
 * range" from the user's own LabResult rows instead of guessing. The block is
 * SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE and GROUNDED: each biomarker carries the canonical
 * name, value, unit, resolved reference bounds, the in/out-of-range verdict,
 * and the measured date — all computed from the DB via the same resolver the
 * Labs API + doctor-report PDF use (`resolveLabFields` / `classifyReferenceRange`),
 * never re-derived. The Coach reads these numbers verbatim and must not invent
 * a lab value the block does not carry.
 *
 * Bounding (no unbounded history dump):
 *  - MOST RECENT reading per biomarker only (one row per analyte).
 *  - Last `LOOKBACK_MONTHS` months — stale panels do not enter the prompt.
 *  - At most `MAX_BIOMARKERS` biomarkers, newest reading first, so a heavy
 *    history can never balloon the prompt.
 *
 * Qualitative readings (`value` null, `valueText` "negativ" / …) are included
 * with a neutral `"unknown"` range status — there is nothing to compare against
 * the bounds, so no in/out verdict is fabricated. The encrypted `noteEncrypted`
 * column is never selected — the decrypted note must not reach the prompt.
 *
 * v1.30.25 — every free-text string in this block is sanitised, not just
 * `valueText`. The header used to claim `valueText` was "the one
 * user-controlled string here"; that was wrong. `analyte`, `panel` and `unit`
 * are equally attacker-reachable and, unlike `valueText`, they are not even
 * self-scoped: a lab row committed from an uploaded document carries whatever
 * name a model transcribed out of that PDF, stored verbatim as
 * `Biomarker.name` by `resolveOrMintBiomarker`. The document is the untrusted
 * party, not the user. These fields feed BOTH the snapshot prompt and the
 * `labs_read` tool result, so sanitisation lives here at the shared source.
 *
 * `userId` is narrowed from the authenticated session by the caller and feeds
 * the Prisma `where` field-by-field; it is never an input. Unlike the illness
 * block, Labs is intentionally NOT module-gated (mirrors `/api/labs` — the data
 * is always owner-scoped and safe to read), so the block is `null` only when the
 * account has no recent readings.
