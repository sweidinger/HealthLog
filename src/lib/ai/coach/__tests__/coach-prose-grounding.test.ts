/**
 * v1.21.0 (P6 / C2-5) — post-hoc numeric verifier on Coach prose. It must flag
 * a number the model cited that no tool returned this turn (transcription
 * drift), exempt structural window/ordinal integers, and no-op when no tool
 * returned figures. Soft-strip replaces only the flagged tokens.
 *
 * v1.32.1 — closes three real-world false-positive shapes reported against
 * grounded Coach replies: a correctly-computed derived delta/average/percent
 * between two of a payload's own headline figures, a calendar-date ordinal
 * ("July 21st") mangled mid-word into "[unverified]st", and a numbered-list
 * recommendation line ("1. Cut back on sodium") whose marker got flagged as a
 * bare figure. Each new case is paired with an adversarial case proving a
 * genuine fabrication in the SAME shape is still caught.
