/**
 * Regression-class ban for the German-default locale binary.
 *
 * The bug this pins had exactly one shape: `locale === "en" ? "en" : "de"`
 * (and its `=== "de" ? ... : ...` inversions with a `de` fallback). Every
 * occurrence sent French, Spanish, Italian and Polish accounts down the German
 * branch. This walks the source of the surfaces that carried it and fails on
 * the shape itself, so a future edit cannot quietly reintroduce it.
 *
 * Scoped to the files this change owns — the coach memory refresh, the coach
 * snapshot's narrative recall, the narrative route + generator + warm, and the
 * dashboard briefing recall. Blunt by design: it matches text, not behaviour,
 * which is precisely what makes it survive a refactor of the logic around it.
