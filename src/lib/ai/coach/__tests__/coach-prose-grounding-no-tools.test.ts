 * v1.21.2 (A8) — no-tools/local-provider parity for the prose number-verifier.

 * On the no-tools path the Coach has no tools, so the authoritative figure set
 * is the SNAPSHOT the model was shown — the structured `snapshot.sections`
 * record `snapshotJson` is serialised from, which already carries the
 * correlations-snapshot block. This proves the SAME verifier grades prose
 * against that record: a number present in the snapshot (including a
 * correlations-block leaf) is not flagged; a number absent from it is flagged
 * exactly as on the tool path.
