/**
 * v1.18.10 (MEDIUM-1) — resolved-Coach-prompt contract parity.
 *
 * `safety-contracts-parity.test.ts` asserts every ground-rule BODY in the
 * matrix is non-empty per locale. This file goes one step further and asserts
 * the *resolved* `getCoachSystemPrompt(locale)` string — the exact text the
 * provider sees — carries the grounding + GLP-1 dose-safety contract for EVERY
 * UI locale, not just de/en. The audit's residual MEDIUM-1 risk was that a
 * non-EN/DE locale could silently fall back to the EN-plus-footer path (or a
 * native body that weakened the wording) and ship a less-strict Coach. These
 * assertions fail the build if that ever happens.
 *
 * Markers used:
 *  - grounding: the literal "SNAPSHOT" token, which the grounding rule's
 *    `must_contain` pins in every locale.
 *  - GLP-1 dose safety: the brand registry (Mounjaro / Ozempic), which is
 *    identical across all six locales (an international registry, never
 *    translated) and only ever appears inside the dose-safety contract.
