/**
 * v1.18.6 — Coach reference-range grounding (W7).
 *
 * Turns the population reference bands W5 landed in
 * `src/lib/reference-ranges.ts` into a compact, citation-aware text block
 * the Coach prompt can read so a reply is GROUNDED in published guidance
 * rather than the model's parametric memory of "what's normal". For each
 * metric the snapshot actually carries, the block states:
 *   - the metric's headline reference band(s), cited to the publishing
 *     body + year (via `referenceLabel` → `medical-citations`), and
 *   - where the user's current value sits against those bands, using the
 *     SAME deterministic `classifyReference()` four-state contract the UI
 *     tiles use — never a recomputed placement.
 *
 * GUARDRAILS (firm — a hallucination-QA pass audits this exact text):
 *   - GENERAL guidance only. The block opens AND closes with a caveat that
 *     these are population anchors, not personal medical advice or a
 *     diagnosis. The Coach safety discipline (refusal rules, dose-deferral)
 *     is unchanged — this is read-only context, never an instruction.
 *   - NO commercial brand names. Every string is sourced from
 *     `reference-ranges.ts` (brand-free by construction) + the metric's
 *     natural-language label here. The unit test asserts the rendered
 *     block contains no brand token.
 *   - Blood pressure is labelled to ESH 2023 (the SHIPPED European
 *     default); the ACC/AHA + ESC framings ride only as `conflicts`
 *     CONTEXT, exactly as the band data authored them — never as the
 *     placement.
 *   - GLUCOSE respects the W6 `hasDiabetes` opt-in. When the user has NOT
 *     opted in, glucose is grounded against the GENERAL non-diabetic
 *     fasting bands. When they HAVE, the block states the tighter ADA
 *     glycemic GOAL band (fasting 80–130 mg/dL) as a clinician-set target,
 *     never a screening threshold and never a diagnosis.
 *
 * Deterministic + pure: same inputs → byte-identical block, no DB, no LLM,
 * no per-call randomness. The block is surfaced verbatim in the Coach
 * user-prompt after the SNAPSHOT so it is fully inspectable.
 *
 * Token budget: the block is bounded by the number of metrics present
 * (one short line each) and a hard `MAX_GROUNDING_METRICS` cap, so even a
 * 15-metric snapshot stays a few hundred tokens.
