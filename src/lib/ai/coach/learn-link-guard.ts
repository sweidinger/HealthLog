/**
 * v1.21.0 (NEW-C C-3) — Coach Learn-link post-filter.
 *
 * The Coach MAY point the user at a public `/learn/<slug>` guide, but only a
 * slug that appears in `learn-catalog.ts`. The system prompt instructs this
 * ("Only link a URL from this list — never invent a /learn URL"), but that is a
 * prompt instruction, not enforcement: a model could still hallucinate
 * `/learn/lower-your-cortisol` and ship a dead/wrong link.
 *
 * This deterministic post-filter runs on the assembled reply before
 * persistence and streaming. It scans for every `/learn/<slug>` reference
 * (relative or the absolute `healthlog.dev/learn/<slug>` form) and NEUTRALISES
 * any whose slug is not a published catalog entry — stripping the fabricated
 * URL out of the prose while leaving the surrounding sentence intact. A real
 * slug is kept verbatim. This converts the catalog's "impossible by
 * construction" claim from a prompt promise into an enforced guarantee.
 *
 * Cheap + read-only: a single regex pass over the reply, the slug set sourced
 * from the read-only `LEARN_GUIDES` catalog. No allocation on the common path
 * (a reply with no `/learn` mention returns the input unchanged).
 */
