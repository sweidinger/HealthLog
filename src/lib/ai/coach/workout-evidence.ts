/**
 * Per-workout evidence block for a Coach conversation launched from a
 * workout ("Ask why" on the workout-detail page, or `/coach?workout=<id>`).
 *
 * ── Why this block is NOT fenced ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The stored-document path (`?doc=`) routes every turn through the hardened
 * fenced endpoint because document text is third-party prose transcribed out
 * of a PDF — an injection surface by construction. A workout row is not:
 * it is the user's own structured sensor record. This block therefore rides
 * the normal Coach prompt as one additional snapshot section.
 *
 * That reasoning only holds if the projection really is numbers-only, so the
 * closure is enforced here rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - Every emitted leaf is a NUMBER, a BOOLEAN, or a token drawn from a
 *     closed server-side vocabulary. `assertNumbersOnly()` walks the built
 *     object and throws on anything else, so a future field that smuggles a
 *     string in fails loudly at build time instead of silently reaching a
 *     prompt.
 *   - `sportType` is a TEXT column at the DB layer (see `Workout.sport_type`
 *     in `prisma/schema.prisma`). The write path constrains it to
 *     `workoutSportTypeEnum`, but the backup-restore path accepts
 *     `z.string().min(1)`, so a restored row can carry arbitrary text. It is
 *     therefore re-asserted against the closed enum here and folded to
 *     `"other"` on a miss — the same whitelist posture the raw-SQL splices
 *     use.
 *   - `metadata` is EXCLUDED wholesale. It carries device bundle ids and
 *     HKWorkoutEvent markers — free text with no numeric value to the
 *     narrative. Only the WHOOP zone durations are read out of it, and only
 *     through the narrow numeric Zod slice `parseWhoopZoneDurations()`.
 *   - `externalId` / `externalSourceVersion` are EXCLUDED — opaque
 *     device-assigned strings.
 *   - Route GEOMETRY is EXCLUDED. The per-point coordinate trace is the
 *     user's location history; the climb figure the narrative needs is
 *     already the numeric `elevationM` column.
 *
 * The conversation-level tenancy narrow (`{ id, userId }`) lives at the call
 * site in the chat route; this module never widens it.
