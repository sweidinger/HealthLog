/**
 * v1.11.0 (Epic B, Pillar 3) — short-horizon trajectory block for the
 * Coach prompt.
 *
 * Folds the deterministic `computeTrajectory` forecasting engine into the
 * Coach snapshot as COMPACT per-metric projections: direction + slope +
 * the projected END of the horizon with its widening prediction band, the
 * last observed value, and the fit's R² / confidence. The Coach narrates
 * the SAME numbers the engine computed (single source of truth) — it never
 * invents a forecast; the projection is computed off-LLM and the model
 * only describes a band that is already here, and only when present.
 *
 * Every entry reads the one `computeTrajectory` contract — NEVER a
 * recompute. A metric whose projection is `insufficient` (below the
 * R²/history/staleness floor) is OMITTED entirely; the block is omitted
 * when none of the in-scope metrics resolve to `ok`, so the Coach prompt's
 * conditional-projection ground rule has nothing to narrate and (per that
 * rule) does not project.
 *
 * Server-only — calls the trajectory engine, which reads the rollup tier +
 * raw rows via the baseline reader.
