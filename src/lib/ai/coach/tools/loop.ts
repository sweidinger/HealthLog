/**
 * v1.20.0 (F1) — bounded Coach retrieval loop.
 *
 * Runs the agentic call → tool-result → answer cycle on top of the existing
 * `runRawCompletionWithFallback` chain. Each round is a NON-streaming
 * completion (the chain returns a whole body); the route fake-tokenises the
 * FINAL prose for the visible stream exactly as before.
 *
 * Bounds (the loop can never run away):
 *   - MAX_ROUNDS = 3 (v1.21.0 D5): up to three tool-fetch rounds before the
 *     forced answer, so a sequential cross-metric "why" chain isn't starved.
 *   - HARD_CAP = MAX_ROUNDS + 1: an absolute ceiling; on the last allowed round
 *     the loop re-calls with `toolChoice:"none"` so the model is FORCED to
 *     produce prose even if it would otherwise keep asking for tools.
 *   - Tool calls within a round run in parallel (`Promise.all`).
 *
 * Token accounting: the caller reserves `maxTokens * MAX_ROUNDS` up front and
 * reconciles the SUMMED `tokensUsed` this function returns. The atomic
 * reserve/reconcile primitives are unchanged.
 *
 * Provider fallback: when the working provider does not support tools
 * (`supportsTools === false`) or returns no tool calls, the loop degrades to a
 * single completion — the caller falls back to the snapshot path BEFORE
 * entering this loop, so this is the safety floor, not the primary route.
