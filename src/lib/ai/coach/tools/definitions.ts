/**
 * v1.20.0 (F1) — Coach retrieval tool catalogue.
 *
 * Replaces snapshot-stuffing with on-demand retrieval: the model is handed a
 * tiny DATA INVENTORY in the base context and pulls only the domains it needs
 * via these tools. Each tool is a THIN, READ-ONLY wrapper over the existing
 * server-authoritative snapshot builder (`buildCoachSnapshot`) — same numbers,
 * same module/cycle gates, same I/O. No tool ever accepts `userId` (it is
 * narrowed from the session in the executor), and every tool is read-only, so
 * there is no new mutation or egress surface.
 *
 * Tools ship as a closed catalogue:
 *   1. get_metric_series         — BP / weight / pulse + the ~38 additive series
 *   2. get_glucose_panel         — per-context daily means + the 30-day clinical panel
 *   3. get_sleep                 — per-night sleep + sleep-rhythm (debt + chronotype)
 *   4. get_medication_compliance — dose-weighted compliance + GLP-1
 *   5. get_labs                  — latest reading per biomarker (12 months)
 *   6. get_illness_recovery      — restMode + active/resolved illnesses + recovery composites
 *   7. get_workouts              — recent sessions + per-sport rollup (v1.21.0, C2-4)
 *   8. get_cycle                 — menstrual phase / prediction / correlation (v1.21.0, C2-1)
 *   9. get_correlations          — discovered FDR cross-metric drivers + the
 *                                  coincident-deviation flag (v1.21.0, C3)
