/**
 * v1.21.0 (C3) — Coach correlations reader.
 *
 * Surfaces the deterministic insight engine's cross-metric intelligence to the
 * Coach via the `get_correlations` tool. Two read-only sources, both already
 * computed elsewhere and reused verbatim here (no new statistics):
 *
 *  - The FDR-controlled, day-D→D+1 lagged all-pairs discovery
 *    (`@/lib/insights/correlation-discovery`). We run the SAME full-matrix scan
 *    the `/api/insights/correlations` route + the per-metric card run, so the
 *    Coach never surfaces a pair the insight pages would not — same Pearson,
 *    same exact p-value, same Benjamini-Hochberg control. We return every
 *    surviving pair (not filtered to one metric) as a descriptive driver row.
 *  - The coincident-deviation flag (`computeCoincidentDeviation`): "two or more
 *    of your vitals are outside their usual band today", with the illness-
 *    explained reframe carried through.
 *
 * Grounding posture mirrors the other tools: a structured `{ present: false }`
 * when too little paired data exists for any pattern to survive (or the read
 * fails), never a throw and never an ambiguous empty list. The driver rows are
 * descriptive — direction + lag + n + the engine's own never-causal
 * interpretation string — so the Coach states the observed linkage without
 * inventing a relationship.
