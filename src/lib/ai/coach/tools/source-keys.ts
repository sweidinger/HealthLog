/**
 * v1.20.0 (F1) — CoachScopeSource → snapshot section key map.
 *
 * `get_metric_series` fetches a single metric by re-running the snapshot
 * builder scoped to that one source, then reads the matching section out of the
 * structured `CoachSnapshotResult.sections`. The builder names each section by
 * a camelCase key (e.g. `heartRateVariability`); this map mirrors the
 * `valueBlocks` table in `snapshot.ts` plus the three core clinical blocks
 * (bloodPressure / weight / pulse) and the mood block.
 *
 * `glucose` and `workouts` are intentionally absent: they have dedicated tools
 * / branches (glucose carries the clinical panel; workouts is deferred). A
 * `get_metric_series` call for one of them resolves to `null` here and the
 * executor returns `{ present: false }` with a pointer to the right tool.
 *
 * The `source-keys.test.ts` guard asserts every `coachScopeSourceSchema` value
 * either resolves here or is explicitly one of the dedicated-tool sources, so a
 * future source addition cannot silently fall through to a fabricated answer.
