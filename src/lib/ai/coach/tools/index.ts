/**
 * v1.20.0 (F1) — Coach retrieval-tool barrel.
 *
 * The on-demand retrieval slice that replaces snapshot-stuffing: a tiny DATA
 * INVENTORY in the base context, six read-only tools the model calls to fetch
 * figures, and a bounded loop that executes them. The legacy snapshot path
 * stays alive as the no-tools fallback (per-provider `supportsTools`).
