/**
 * Coach OUTBOUND safety screen — the conversational surface's binding of the
 * shared screen in `@/lib/ai/safety/outbound-screen`.
 *
 * `detectRefusal()` guards the INBOUND channel (the user's message) only. The
 * model's reply was tokenised and streamed verbatim with no equivalent
 * server-side check, so a dose-prescription ("step up to 2.4 mg") or a
 * fabricated risk score in the assistant turn reached the user unfiltered. The
 * GLP-1 dose-safety contract and grounding block are composed into the Coach
 * system prompt, but those are instructions, not enforcement.
 *
 * The chat route already buffers the full reply before streaming (the provider
 * clients return the body in one shot, then `tokeniseForStreaming` chunks it
 * for the UI), so the screen runs on the assembled reply BEFORE persistence and
 * streaming. That buffer-then-screen order is load-bearing: every token the
 * client can see is post-guard.
 *
 * SURFACE POLICY — REPLACE. The Coach is a synchronous, user-initiated turn.
 * The user is waiting on an answer, so silence would read as a failure; on a
 * trip the route swaps in a calm "talk to your prescriber" fallback turn. This
 * is the policy every user-initiated surface uses (see the document summary);
 * background-generated cached surfaces WITHHOLD instead.
 *
 * The pattern banks, their six-locale coverage, and the false-positive posture
 * all live in the shared module — this file owns only the Coach's contract
 * selection and its fallback copy.
