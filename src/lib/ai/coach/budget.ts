/**
 * Per-user, per-day token budget for the AI Coach.
 *
 * Why a separate ledger and not a generic counter on `User`:
 *   - The dispatcher must read the day's spend on every request — a
 *     scalar column would balloon write contention as concurrent
 *     requests race.
 *   - A `(userId, dateKey)` row partitions the writes by day and lets
 *     us add per-day analytics ("avg replies per active user") later
 *     without further migrations.
 *
 * `dateKey` is a UTC `YYYY-MM-DD` string. UTC, not Europe/Berlin: the
 * job runner that may seed off-hour tasks (planned v1.5) needs a
 * boundary that does not jump on DST. Display layers can format with
 * the user's timezone.
