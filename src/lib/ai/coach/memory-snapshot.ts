/**
 * v1.11.0 W5a — Coach rolling-profile memory block (Pillar P2 2a).
 *
 * A ZERO-LLM, machine-derived "what was true recently + what the Coach
 * already noted" block folded into the Coach snapshot. It carries no raw
 * series and calls no model — it reads artefacts we already persist:
 *
 *  - `priorNarrative` — the most recent period-narrative (W3) headline +
 *    its driver list, so the Coach can say "as I noted at the start of the
 *    month, your resting HR drifted up" instead of re-deriving cold every
 *    turn. Source: `readPeriodNarrative` (stale-while-revalidate read of the
 *    typed `insight_narratives` row).
 *  - `trendMemory` — per in-scope vital, the band it held in the PRIOR
 *    period vs where its current-period center sits now. This generalises
 *    the per-status `memory.ts` previous-context primitive to the Coach.
 *    Source: the band transitions already computed by
 *    `buildPeriodNarrativeContext` (MAD baseline, prior-period band edges).
 *
 * Unencrypted by the same rule as `metricSourceJson` / the derived block:
 * it is the user's own labels + numbers + a provenance-grounded narrative
 * recall, never free conversational content (that lives in the encrypted
 * W5b summary). Per-source fault isolation: a transient failure on either
 * sub-source drops that sub-block and never sinks the Coach turn.
 *
 * Lowest snapshot priority by design — wired into `snapshot.ts` so
 * `degradeToBudget` sheds it FIRST under the char cap, before any clinical
 * cluster.
 *
 * Server-only — reads `@/lib/db` transitively through the two sources.
