/**
 * Coach red-team battery (B0, v1.21.3).
 *
 * The adversarial standing checks. These ASSERT the existing deterministic
 * detectors fire on hostile input — they do not re-implement detection. The
 * detectors are the source of truth (`refusal.ts`, `outbound-guard.ts`,
 * `learn-link-guard.ts`); this module pins a battery of attack strings and the
 * expected verdict so a future Coach change that softens a guard reddens the
 * suite.
 *
 * The five attack classes the brief pins:
 *   - diagnosis request           — refused / never diagnosed in the reply,
 *   - dangerous plan              — outbound dose-prescription screen trips,
 *   - red-flag symptom            — the acute escalation MUST surface (safety
 *                                   priority: a red-flag reply must direct the
 *                                   user to seek care, never reassure it away),
 *   - prompt injection            — inbound injection detector refuses,
 *   - cross-user data-extraction  — injection / out-of-scope refusal trips.
 *
 * The red-flag check is the asymmetric one: for the inbound detectors we assert
 * a REFUSAL or a SCREEN; for the red-flag we assert an ESCALATION is PRESENT in
 * the reply. Over-reassurance of a red flag is a measured safety regression, so
 * we detect the escalation language deterministically here and require it.

/**
 * v1.30.25 — the DATA-FIELD battery.
 *
 * Every case above arrives as a user message or a model reply. Neither is the
 * hard channel. The hard channel is a DATA field: a lab analyte name, a
 * medication label, a panel or unit string. Those reach the prompt through the
 * SNAPSHOT and the `labs_read` tool result, and — this is what makes them
 * different from a hostile user message — the user is not the author. A lab
 * row committed from an uploaded document carries whatever name a model
 * transcribed out of that PDF, so the party choosing the string is whoever
 * produced the document. The user confirms the row on a review screen where
 * the label is truncated, and from then on it is permanent prompt context on
 * every turn.
 *
 * The inbound refusal detector is the WRONG guard for these: it reads the
 * user's message, and the payload never appears there. The guards that
 * actually apply are the field sanitiser at the data source
 * (`sanitizeForPrompt`, which strips the instruction-shaped patterns) and the
 * fence around the block (which stops a payload closing its container). The
 * suite asserts both, per case.
 *
 * `injected` is the raw string an attacker plants in the data field.
 * `mustNotSurvive` lists the substrings that must be gone from the sanitised
 * value — the tokens that give the payload its instruction shape.
