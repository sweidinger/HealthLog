/**
 * Coach evaluation golden set (B0, v1.21.3).
 *
 * A fixed library of representative Coach turns, each pinned with the snapshot
 * the model is shown, the user's message, an optional scripted tool-result set
 * (for the tool path), and a list of BEHAVIOUR-ANCHORED binary criteria. The
 * criteria are weighted yes/no checks ("does the prose anchor against the
 * user's own range?", "does a sparse-data answer hedge rather than verdict?"),
 * not open-ended scores — so the deterministic grader can gate every Coach
 * change without a model call, and the same cases feed the opt-in live judge
 * (layer 2) for the open-ended remainder.
 *
 * Taxonomy (seeded from the D5 case taxonomy):
 *   - grounding       — a cited number must trace to a snapshot/tool leaf.
 *   - crossMetric     — a "why is X low?" answer surfaces a DRIVER, not two
 *                       tiles read side by side.
 *   - dataHonesty     — a sparse history (a handful of readings) yields a
 *                       "still learning" framing, never a confident verdict.
 *   - providerParity  — the same case on the tool path and the no-tools path
 *                       both surface the driver / honour the same floor.
 *   - ownBaseline     — the answer is framed against the USER's own range,
 *                       never a population norm.
 *
 * The criteria here are graded by the deterministic graders in this directory
 * against a SCRIPTED prose string (the case's `idealResponse` on the
 * deterministic path, the model's real generation on the live-judge path). The
 * deterministic suite proves the GRADERS themselves are correct and that the
 * ideal responses clear them; the live judge proves real generations do too.
