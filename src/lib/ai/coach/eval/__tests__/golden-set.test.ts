/**
 * Coach golden-set gate (B0, v1.21.3) — the per-PR deterministic floor.
 *
 * Grades every golden case's reference response through the deterministic
 * graders. A reference response is authored to clear every `mustInclude` and
 * trip no `mustAvoid`; this suite proves the graders + criteria are
 * self-consistent and that the floor holds. A future Coach change that, say,
 * weakens the own-baseline matcher or the grounding verifier reddens this gate.
 *
 * No model call, no network — this is the free gate that runs on every change.
