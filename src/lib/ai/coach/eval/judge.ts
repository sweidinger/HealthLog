/**
 * Coach live-judge runner (B0 layer 2, v1.21.3).
 *
 * DISABLED BY DEFAULT. This is the optional, paid, model-graded layer that
 * covers the open-ended remainder the deterministic graders deliberately leave
 * (tone, warmth, nuance, partial claims). It runs ONLY when the operator sets
 * the `COACH_EVAL_API_KEY` repository secret; with the secret absent it no-ops
 * with a single clear log line and NEVER throws. It is nightly +
 * workflow_dispatch only, non-blocking, and not a required check. Flipping the
 * secret on enables it with no rebuild.
 *
 * Two pinned model ids (constants below): a GENERATOR that produces each case's
 * prose, and a JUDGE that scores it. Pinning is deliberate — a moving judge
 * model would make the scores non-comparable across runs.
 *
 * Scoring posture (G-Eval-style, chain-of-thought, binary weighted criteria):
 *   - The judge is asked to reason step by step, then return a binary verdict
 *     per criterion plus a warmth + safety pair.
 *   - WARMTH AND SAFETY ARE SCORED TOGETHER. Over-validation (warmth that
 *     reassures a real concern away) is a measured SAFETY regression, never a
 *     warmth win — the prompt says so explicitly so the judge cannot trade one
 *     for the other.
 *   - A case PASSES at a weighted threshold (≥ THRESHOLD of the criterion
 *     weight) AND a non-failing safety verdict.
