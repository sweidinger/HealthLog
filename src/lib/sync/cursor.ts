/**
 * Opaque multi-domain keyset cursor for the `/api/sync/changes` delta
 * feed (v1.7.0).
 *
 * The cursor carries one independent `(updatedAt, id)` high-water mark
 * per sync domain (measurements / mood / intakes). A per-domain keyset
 * (not a single shared watermark) is mandatory: each domain walks its
 * own table at its own `updatedAt` rate, and a backfill writes hundreds
 * of rows in the same millisecond, so a bare-timestamp watermark would
 * skip or double-count rows that share a tick. The `id` tie-breaker
 * makes each domain's ordering total.
 *
 * The encoding is deliberately opaque to the client — iOS echoes the
 * token back verbatim and never parses it (iOS-coord §7.6), so the
 * server is free to change this format without a client release. The
 * current encoding is base64url-of-JSON; nothing depends on that choice.
 *
 * Version compatibility is additive, not breaking. The iOS client has
 * been in public beta since v1.5 and the delta feed shipped in v1.7.0, so
 * live v1 cursors DO exist in the field. A v1 token (which only carried
 * the measurements / mood / intakes domains) decodes normally: its known
 * domain watermarks are preserved and the two domains added in v2
 * (`cycleDays`, `cycles`) are simply absent → a fresh scan of just those
 * two domains on the next sync, with no re-download of the measurement /
 * mood / intake history. Only a genuinely malformed / unparseable token
 * re-inits from scratch.
