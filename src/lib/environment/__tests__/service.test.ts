/**
 * v1.25 (W-ENV) — conservative location resolution.
 *
 * Pins the precedence (explicit period → [DEVICE, reserved] → home-on/after-
 * effective-from → SKIP) and the conservative default backfill range. The whole
 * point is that a past day is NEVER attributed to the current home unless the
 * home was already effective on that day; otherwise it is skipped and left to an
 * explicit location period. `@/lib/db` + the Open-Meteo client are stubbed so
 * the pure functions import without touching Postgres or the network.
