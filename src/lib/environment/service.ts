/**
 * v1.25 (W-ENV) — environmental-context resolution + fetch/upsert service.
 *
 * Owns the location-precedence logic and the per-day upsert into
 * `EnvironmentContext`. Both the nightly job and the on-demand backfill route
 * call {@link fetchAndStoreEnvironment} so the precedence, the day-keying, and
 * the upsert live in exactly one place.
 *
 * Location precedence per day (first hit wins) — CONSERVATIVE:
 *   1. an explicit dated LOCATION PERIOD (override) whose [startDate, endDate]
 *      covers the day (a trip, OR a corrected stretch of history);
 *   2. DEVICE — reserved slot for a future client-supplied coarse per-day
 *      location (iOS v2); not produced server-side yet (see resolver comment);
 *   3. the user's HOME location, but ONLY for days on/after `homeSince` (the
 *      instant the home became effective).
 * A day before `homeSince`, or with no home and no covering period, is SKIPPED.
 * The resolver never attributes a past day to the *current* home — that would
 * fabricate weather for anyone who has moved/travelled. The deep past is filled
 * by adding explicit dated location periods.
 *
 * Coarse location only — the resolver never sees finer than the rounded city
 * coordinates stored on the user / override.
