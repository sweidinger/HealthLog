/**
 * v1.11.1 — source-aware SQL collapse helpers.
 *
 * The rollup writer mints one row per (type, day, source); the live
 * measurement reads see one raw row per reading. For overlapping standard
 * vitals (e.g. WHOOP + Apple Watch resting heart rate) both the rollup
 * all-time aggregate and the live 90-day aggregates must resolve to the
 * source-priority ladder's canonical source per (type, day) before composing,
 * or a dual-source user double-counts / blends two devices.
 *
 * `collapseRollupRowsBySource` does this in application code for the row-by-row
 * readers. These helpers do the equivalent IN SQL so the slim slice + the
 * comprehensive aggregator + the live `/api/measurements` fallback keep their
 * single-round-trip `GROUP BY type` shape (no six-figure row transfer).
 *
 * Every spliced literal is a closed-enum value (`MeasurementType` /
 * `MeasurementSource`) asserted against `/^[A-Z0-9_]+$/`, the same whitelist
 * convention the rollup writer uses for its date-trunc + type-list splices.
 * The user id is always passed as a bound parameter, never spliced.
