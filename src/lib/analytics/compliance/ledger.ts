/**
 * v1.15.18 — the unified compliance tally over the dose-history ledger.
 *
 * THE single source of the medication compliance %. It builds the
 * cadence-aware `SlotBand[]` per schedule (the shared band minter — every
 * cadence: daily, fixed-weekday, rolling-retrospective, one-shot, cyclic,
 * PRN), reconstructs the ONE dose-history ledger
 * (`reconstructDoseHistory`), and tallies it so the percentage and the
 * history view are mathematically incapable of contradicting each other
 * (audit CRITICAL-2). It replaces the ±12h `pairDoses` proximity matcher
 * that `calculateCompliance` used for the engine-routed path.
 *
 * The tally follows the adherence literature's TAKING-vs-TIMING split:
 *   - numerator (taken) = `taken_on_time` + `taken_late` — a late dose is
 *     still a taken dose; "late" is NOT collapsed into "missed";
 *   - denominator = taken + `missed`;
 *   - EXCLUDED from the denominator: `skipped` (deliberate user decision),
 *     `ad_hoc` (off-schedule top-up — no defensible slot), `upcoming` (the
 *     window hasn't opened), and ENTIRE PRN groups (`hasExpectedSlots:false`
 *     — PRN has no defensible denominator per the literature);
 *   - the rate is capped at 100% (extra doses never inflate it).
 *
 * The on-time / late split is surfaced separately so a caller can show both
 * the TAKING rate (the headline) and the TIMING quality.
 *
 * Pure / synchronous: the bands are minted from pre-fetched schedules +
 * intake instants; no DB access.

 * (the off-week of a bi-weekly schedule) emits no point at all and therefore

 * rows (the window hasn't opened) are dropped before grouping, exactly as the
 * window tally excludes them. A day whose only ledger rows are skips yields no
 * point (zero denominator) rather than a misleading 0%.

 * zone keeps an evening dose on the local day it was actually due: a fixed
 * Berlin key filed a `20:00 America/Los_Angeles` dose (04:00 UTC next day)
