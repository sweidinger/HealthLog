/**
 * v1.13.x Fix 4 — the current-cycle descriptor. SEPARATE from the
 * percentage rows: a sparse med (weekly+ injection) whose current cycle is
 * not yet due must NOT render a scary red 0%. The percentage rows reflect
 * only CLOSED cycles (the open forward cycle is `upcoming`, excluded from
 * the denominator); this descriptor carries the open-cycle state so the
 * card can render a neutral "next dose in N days" / "due today" / "overdue"
 * line decoupled from the rate.
 *
 * States:
 *   - `on_track`: `now < nextDueAt`. The next dose simply hasn't come round.
 *   - `due`: `nextDueAt ≤ now ≤ graceUntil`. A neutral / amber call-to-action.
 *   - `missed`: `now > graceUntil` and the cycle has no logged intake. The
 *     only state that should tint red.
 *   - `none`: no schedule projects a next dose (PRN, paused, ended). The
 *     card shows no current-cycle line.
 *
 * `hasClosedCycles` is false for a brand-new sparse med with zero closed
 * dose cycles — the card then surfaces a neutral "no closed dose cycles
 * yet" state instead of a misleading 100% / 0%.
