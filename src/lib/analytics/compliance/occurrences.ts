 * compliance payload so iOS history renders a "missed" mark only on days
 * the schedule actually expected a dose (not off-weeks / non-matching
 * weekdays / PRN days).
 *
 * v1.13.x — pass `intakes` so a ROLLING schedule routes through the
 * retrospective grid (each logged dose is a `due` day, plus skipped-cycle
 * misses + a past-due forward slot) instead of the engine's single forward
 * slot. Omitting `intakes` keeps the forward-only behaviour for callers that
 * don't have the intake history at hand.

/**
 * v1.8.5 — the sibling of {@link expectedSlotCountForDay} that returns the
 * expected-dose occurrences *themselves* (ascending by instant) over an
 * arbitrary window, rather than just the per-day count. Same loop, same
 * canonical-engine delegation; we keep the slots so the dose-adherence
 * timeline can pair each expected slot to its intake.
 *
 * Used by {@link buildComplianceDisplay} to decide the card's render mode
 * (percent bars vs an uptime-style per-dose strip) and to build the strip.
 * `occurrencesBetween` is inclusive of both ends; the caller passes a
 * `[from, to]` window and we sort the union of every schedule's slots so
 * a multi-schedule medication interleaves its slots in time order.
 *
 * v1.8.6 QA — the window lower bound is clamped to `ctx.createdAt`. The
 * legacy weekday walker floors on `startsOn` but not on `createdAt`, so a
 * brand-new daily med queried over a 30-day window would otherwise emit
 * slots for every day before it existed (7/30 expected on a 2-day-old med).
 * Clamping here keeps the expected-dose denominator — and the window
 * selection that reads it — honest about the medication's real age. The
 * displayed rates clamp independently via `calculateCompliance`'s
 * `medicationCreatedAt` argument, so this only fixes the slot counts.
