/**
 * v1.16.11 (#316) — as-needed (PRN) medications are excluded from every
 * surface that computes or displays a compliance rate. A PRN medication
 * has no expected doses, so it must contribute NEITHER 0% NOR 100% to
 * any rate, streak, or aggregate.
 *
 * Source pins: each call site that feeds the compliance engine fetches
 * its medications with an explicit `asNeeded: false` predicate. The pin
 * walks the medication-feeding `findMany` of every rate-surfacing call
 * site (the documented set: Coach prompt, BP-status gate, health-score
 * pillar, insight features / targets / comprehensive, the nightly
 * compliance status, the batched card-compliance payload) and asserts
 * the predicate is present — a refactor that drops it fails here before
 * a PRN medication can drag a user's rate to 0% (never-taken-on-no-
 * schedule) or pad it to 100% (vacuous denominator).
