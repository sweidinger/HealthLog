/**
 * Calculate compliance for a medication over a given period.
 *
 * Honours `daysOfWeek` (e.g. `"1"` for Mondays only) and
 * `intervalWeeks` (bi-weekly, tri-weekly, …) by delegating to
 * `buildCadenceTimeline`. The denominator is the number of dose slots
 * the schedule actually emits inside the window — not
 * `schedules.length * days`. A user on a weekly Monday-only schedule
 * who takes every Monday for 30 days reports 100% adherence (4 of 4
 * Mondays) instead of the pre-v1.5.0 ~13% (4 of 30).
 *
 * Skipped doses are excluded from the denominator (deliberate user
 * decision, not a compliance failure). When the window contains no
 * expected doses (paused med, brand-new prescription, schedule that
 * never fires in the window) the helper returns `rate: 100` so the
 * empty state doesn't trip a "0% compliance" alarm downstream.
 *
 * Streak counts consecutive days, ending at `now`, where every
 * expected dose for the day was taken (or skipped). Days with no
 * expected dose (out-of-cadence weekdays, off-weeks on a bi-weekly
 * schedule) advance the streak — the user gets credit for not
 * breaking on non-scheduled days.
 *
 * @param events         Recorded intake events from
 *                       `MedicationIntakeEvent`. Only `scheduledFor`,
 *                       `takenAt`, `skipped` are read.
 * @param schedules      Schedule rows for the medication. `daysOfWeek`
 *                       is read when present; missing field is treated
 *                       as daily.
 * @param days           Rolling-window size in days (typically 7 / 30
 *                       / 90).
 * @param medicationCreatedAt
 *                       When provided, days before the medication
 *                       existed are excluded so they don't count as
 *                       "missed".
 * @param options.now    Override for the rolling-window anchor. The
 *                       fast-path Health-Score helper passes a fixed
 *                       `now` so cached medication-compliance rates
 *                       agree with the score's other pillars; default
 *                       is `new Date()` (current wall-clock instant).
 *                       v1.5.0 — added so the cadence-aware adapter
