/**
 * v1.15.9 — cadence-aware per-dose grace/miss window model.
 *
 * A medication's dose either is on-time, is still takeable but late
 * (counts when taken), or has slipped past the point where a self-hoster
 * could plausibly still take it (a MISS). The cutoffs differ by cadence:
 * an intraday/daily dose has tight hour-scale windows; a weekly/rolling
 * injectable (the GLP-1 case) follows the clinical "take it within 4 days,
 * otherwise skip to the next scheduled dose" rule.
 *
 * The defaults below are centralised named constants so a future revision
 * can expose them per-medication without re-deriving the boundaries. Make
 * it correct first; configurability later.
 *
 * DAILY / INTRADAY (minute-scale windows around the target instant):
 *   - on-time:    target − 60 min … target + 60 min
 *   - overdue:    target + 60 min … target + 240 min  (still takeable)
 *   - missed:     > target + 240 min, OR the next dose's on-time window
 *                 starts first (whichever is sooner — adjacent doses never
 *                 overlap).
 *
 * WEEKLY / ROLLING injectable (day-scale windows; the 4-day clinical rule):
 *   - on-time:    target day ± 1 day
 *   - overdue:    up to target + 4 days  (late-but-counts)
 *   - missed:     > target + 4 days
