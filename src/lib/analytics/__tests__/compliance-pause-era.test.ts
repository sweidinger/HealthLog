/**
 * v1.25 correctness fixes — two compliance-denominator regressions.
 *
 * H-MED1: a paused medication's gap must NOT count as missed once the
 * medication resumes. The pause interval lives in `MedicationPauseEra`
 * (threaded onto `ComplianceMedicationContext.pauseEras`); the ledger drops
 * expected slots whose anchor falls inside `[pausedAt, resumedAt ?? now)` so
 * the denominator never inflates with the paused days.
 *
 * M-MED3: the compliance rate must honour archived schedule eras
 * (`scheduleRevisions`). A past day scores against the schedule that was live
 * THEN, not the current one. This pins that threading `scheduleRevisions`
 * through `buildComplianceMedicationContext` changes the rate — the exact
 * behaviour the Health-Score fast-path was missing (it never threaded eras).
 *
 * All instants are UTC; run under `TZ=UTC` so the day grid is deterministic.
