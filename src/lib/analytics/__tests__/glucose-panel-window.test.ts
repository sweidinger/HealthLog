/**
 * v1.17.0 — the glucose clinical panel window is one exported constant.
 *
 * `GLUCOSE_PANEL_WINDOW_DAYS` (30) is the single source of truth for the
 * window the TIR / GMI / eA1C / CV panel covers wherever it renders outside an
 * ad-hoc report period: the analytics route, the dashboard snapshot, and the
 * Coach snapshot. This test pins the value AND asserts all three consumers
 * import the constant rather than re-typing a bare `30`, so the "same number
 * everywhere" guarantee can't silently drift. The doctor PDF deliberately uses
 * the report period and is excluded.
