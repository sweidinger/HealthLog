/**
 * v1.5.0 — `calculateCompliance` is a cadence-aware adapter over
 * `buildCadenceTimeline`. The historical wire shape (`totalExpected`,
 * `taken`, `skipped`, `missed`, `rate`, `streak`) is unchanged, but
 * the numbers now honour `daysOfWeek` and `intervalWeeks`. These
 * tests pin the contract for every cadence the production app
 * exercises: daily 1×/day, daily multi-dose, weekly Mondays-only,
 * bi-weekly, weekday-only multi-dose, and the DST-boundary day.
 * Closes #214.
 *
 * Each test uses `vi.useFakeTimers()` to pin `now` so the rolling
 * window is deterministic. `classifyIntakeTiming` tests below the
 * matrix are unchanged from the v1.4 line.
