/**
 * BP-in-target percentage helper.
 *
 * The "BD im Zielbereich" tile on the dashboard reports the share of
 * recent blood-pressure readings that are at or below the user's
 * age-band ceiling. Up to v1.4.14 this lived inline in
 * `src/app/api/analytics/route.ts` and had two latent bugs that made
 * the tile read 0 % even when the user clearly had readings inside the
 * target band:
 *
 * 1. **Wrong denominator (v1.4.14).** The legacy code divided
 *    `inTarget / sysData.length`, but readings are only countable when
 *    a matching diastolic exists within 5 minutes. v1.4.15 A4 fixed the
 *    denominator to count only paired readings.
 *
 * 2. **Wrong target semantics (v1.4.15 -> v1.4.16 A2 regression).** The
 *    v1.4.15 fix kept the original "within narrow goal band" semantics:
 *    `sys >= sysLow && sys <= sysHigh && dia >= diaLow && dia <= diaHigh`.
 *    With ESH 2023 narrow targets (Sys 120-129, Dia 70-79 for under-65)
 *    this collapses to 0 % for healthy normotensive users whose
 *    readings sit BELOW the goal band — the live tenant's actual data has many
 *    readings like 117/79 (textbook normotensive, well-controlled) that
 *    were marked OUT of target because sys < 120. Users intuitively
 *    consider those readings *in target* — and so does clinical
 *    practice ("BP is well-controlled" = "at goal or below the goal
 *    ceiling, not implausibly hypotensive"). The v1.4.16 fix changes
 *    semantics from a narrow band to a one-sided ceiling check with a
 *    clinical floor for true hypotension:
 *
 *      in-target := sys >= 90 AND sys <= sysHigh
 *                  AND dia >= 50 AND dia <= diaHigh
 *
 *    The 90/50 floors are well below any plausible "normal-low" and
 *    flag symptomatic hypotension as out-of-target instead of silently
 *    counting it as good control.
 *
 * 3. **No fallback when timestamps don't pair (v1.4.15 fix).** Withings
 *    imports and moodLog.app imports each write sys + dia as separate
 *    Measurement rows that ought to share a `measuredAt` to the second
 *    — but rounding through different timezones can drift them by
 *    minutes. The 5-minute window was tight; data imported with
 *    hour-level rounding (some legacy Withings ranges) had `timeDiff >
 *    5 min`. The fallback to same-Berlin-day pairing covers that.
 *
 * Pure & deterministic so the unit test suite can pin the exact %.

/**
 * v1.4.18 A1 → v1.4.19 A1 — windowed in-target shares for the dashboard
 * tile.
 *
 * The "BD im Zielbereich" tile renders three numbers:
 *  - Headline: the **all-time** in-target % across every paired reading.
 *  - `7T:`    the in-target % over the trailing 7 days.
 *  - `30T:`   the in-target % over the trailing 30 days.
 *
 * History of the bug:
 *
 *  - Up to v1.4.17 only the 30-day figure was computed; the tile showed
 *    `avg7={null}, avg30={null}` so `7T: —, 30T: —` rendered the dash
 *    fallback even when paired readings existed.
 *  - v1.4.18 A1 wired `avg7` + `avg30` from `computeBpInTargetWindows`,
 *    BUT the analytics route also routed the **headline**
 *    (`bpInTargetPct`) through `windows.last30Days?.pct` — i.e. the
 *    headline was a literal copy of `bpInTargetPct30d`. For the live tenant's prod
 *    data (572 paired readings since 2022, recent 30 days = 50 %, all-time
 *    ≈ 11 %) the tile rendered `50 %` headline, `7T: 50, 30T: 50` and
 *    looked algorithmically pinned to 50/50/50. That was hypothesis-1
 *    from the v1.4.19 A1 brief: "the 7T/30T branches reuse the all-time
 *    percentage" — actually the *other* direction (the all-time headline
 *    reused the 30-day value).
 *  - v1.4.19 A1 surfaces a third `allTime` window so the headline gets
 *    the genuinely-different aggregate. Callers must use `allTime` for
 *    the headline now; the test suite pins this contract.
 *
 * `null` for any window means "no paired readings in that window"; the
 * caller renders the "—" placeholder instead of `0`. Caller must pass
 * UNFILTERED series for `allTime` to produce the correct value — the
 * helper does the windowing internally.
