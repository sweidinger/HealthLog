/**
 * v1.4.25 W5e — cross-source canonical-row picker.
 *
 * Cumulative metrics (steps, active energy, walking/running distance,
 * flights climbed, sleep duration) sum-per-day. When two sources both
 * record steps for the same day — say WITHINGS via the Withings
 * Activity API and APPLE_HEALTH via the iOS passthrough — naïvely
 * summing every row double-counts. This helper picks ONE source per
 * day according to the user's per-metric-class priority list and
 * drops rows from the other sources from the aggregation set.
 *
 * Important: dropping a row from the aggregation set does NOT delete
 * it from the DB. The non-canonical rows stay in `measurements` as an
 * audit trail — the user can flip the priority and the analytics
 * re-pick instantly without a re-sync.
 *
 * v1.4.25 W8c — two-axis pick. After narrowing to the winning source,
 * the picker now consults a device-type ladder ("watch beats phone
 * beats scale") and keeps ONLY the rows from the top-ranked device-
 * type present in that day's bucket. Rationale: a user wearing an
 * Apple Watch + carrying an iPhone + standing on a Withings scale
 * pushes three different hourly step streams into HealthKit; summing
 * them triple-counts. The watch's stream is the most reliable
 * "moving body" signal, so we keep the watch rows and drop the phone
 * + scale rows. Rows tagged with `deviceType = null` resolve to
 * `"unknown"` (lowest rank) and are kept only if NO ranked device-type
 * coexists in the same day — never silently dropped.
 *
 * Picker stays O(n) overall with O(1) device-type rank lookups.

 *
 * `deviceType` is the v1.4.25 W8c nullable column. Legacy rows + every
 * pre-W8c Measurement leaves it `null`; the picker maps null → unknown
 * via `normalizeDeviceType()` so the picker never branches on
 * presence.
 *
 * `type` is the `MeasurementType` enum on each Measurement row and
 * lets the picker reach into the per-metric device-type override
 * without re-deriving it from the caller's `metricKey`. Optional so
 * callers who only carry an aggregation-bucket key (e.g. legacy paths)
 * still compile; the picker falls back to the user-default ladder

/**
 * Pick the canonical-source rows for a per-day cumulative metric.
 *
 * Algorithm (v1.4.25 W8c two-axis):
 *   1. Bucket rows by `dayKey(measuredAt)`.
 *   2. For each day, walk the SOURCE priority list in order and pick
 *      the FIRST source that has any row in that bucket.
 *   3. Among the picked source's rows in that bucket, walk the
 *      DEVICE-TYPE priority list and keep ONLY rows from the FIRST
 *      device-type that has any row in that bucket. Cumulative-metric
 *      callers sum these without double-counting; point-metric
 *      callers pick the latest downstream.
 *   4. If `deviceTypePriority` has a per-metric override keyed by the
 *      row's `MeasurementType`, that wins over the user's default
 *      ladder which wins over `DEFAULT_DEVICE_TYPE_PRIORITY`.
 *   5. Rows whose device-type isn't in the ladder fall through as
 *      `"unknown"`; they only survive when no ranked device-type
 *      coexists in the same day, so legacy NULL-tagged rows still
 *      contribute when they're the only signal.
 *
 * Day-key strategy: the caller supplies the function so the analytics
 * paths (timezone-aware) and tests (deterministic ISO date) can share
 * code without dragging a TZ runtime into the helper.
 *
 * Determinism precondition: input rows MUST be in a deterministic
 * order (typically `ORDER BY measuredAt ASC, id ASC` from the caller's
 * Prisma read). The picker's bucket map preserves insertion order, so
 * the output's stability — including tie-breaking on first-seen
 * device-type — depends on the caller honouring this contract.
 *
 * @returns the filtered row list (subset of input) plus the
 *          per-day picked source — useful for debug overlays / audit
 *          logging downstream.
