/**
 * v1.17 W1b — single Health-Score BP-pillar input builder.
 *
 * The Personal Health Score is computed by `computeUserHealthScoreFastPath`
 * from two server callers: the analytics route (the Insights health-score
 * card) and the dashboard snapshot (the hero ring). Before this builder the
 * two callers assembled the BP-pillar inputs by hand and DIVERGED:
 *
 *   - the analytics route fed the BP pillar from the all-time in-target rate
 *     and passed the prior-week values for the week-over-week delta;
 *   - the dashboard snapshot fed the pillar from the trailing-30-day rate and
 *     omitted the prior-week values entirely (so the ring's delta zeroed BP
 *     out and the pillar's presence gate flipped on a user with BP history
 *     but no readings in the last month).
 *
 * Same user, two different scores and two different bands. v1.17 W1d already
 * unified the WINDOW (both read the trailing-90-day rate); this builder
 * unifies the ASSEMBLY so the window choice, the all-time fallback, the
 * graded-score wiring and the prior-week delta inputs can never drift between
 * the two surfaces again. Both callers pass the identical
 * `BpInTargetEnvelope` pair through here and consume the result verbatim.
 *
 * Pure & deterministic — no I/O. The callers own the
 * `computeBpInTargetFastPath` reads (current + prior-week) and hand the two
 * envelopes in.

/**
 * Build the BP-pillar inputs from the current-window and prior-week

 *
 * - The pillar rate (presence gate + secondary stat) reads the canonical
 *   trailing-90-day window (W1d), falling back to the all-time rate only when
 *   the 90-day window is itself null so a sparse-but-historical account keeps
 *   its BP pillar.
 * - v1.17 W1b — when the 90-day window holds fewer than the confidence floor
 *   (`isWindowSufficient`) the pillar collapses to `null` so a thin-data user
 *   does not get a confident BP pillar grading off a handful of readings. The
 *   dashboard tile shows "collecting data" for the same input; the pillar and
 *   the tile agree on the gate. The all-time fallback still rescues an account
 *   with a deep history but a quiet last quarter.
 * - The prior-week rate uses the prior-week run's 90-day window so the
 *   week-over-week delta compares the same window on both ends.
 * - The graded clinical-proximity score (the pillar VALUE) and its prior-week
 *   counterpart come straight off the envelopes.
 *
 * `null` for the current envelope (no BP targets / no readings) collapses
 * every field to `null`, which the score helper reads as "pillar absent".
