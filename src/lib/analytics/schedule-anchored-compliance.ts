/**
 * v1.26.0 SEAM-N3 — the ONE schedule-anchored, cadence-aware daily
 * compliance computation.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from the `GET /api/medications/intake?scope=compliance`
 * dashboard-tile handler so every surface that surfaces a "taken of expected"
 * adherence number reads through the SAME engine instead of the raw coverage
 * rollup (`readMedicationCompliance`), whose `scheduled` counts LOGGED intake
 * slots — a denominator that collapses to ~100% for a user who logs only the
 * doses they took and never mints `takenAt:null` reminder rows for the ones
 * they missed. See the adherence storyline (`adherence-storyline.ts`) and the
 * dashboard tile: both now consume this.
 *
 * `scheduled` is the canonical recurrence engine's expected-dose count for the
 * day, summed across the user's active medications, so days the schedule
 * expected a dose that the user missed pull the rate down — and the 7/30/90
 * windows genuinely diverge with partial adherence. `taken` stays the count of
 * taken (non-skipped, non-auto-missed) doses that day, capped at the day's
 * expected count so a duplicate log can't push a day above 100%.
 *
 * Pure-ish over a single pinned `now` so a cached row is internally
 * consistent. Bounded: one active-medications query + one window-events query,
 * then per-medication-per-day engine expansion over the trailing window.
