/**
 * v1.4.36 — slim `summaries` slice for `/api/analytics?slice=summaries`.
 *
 * The default `/api/analytics` path fans out 30+ `Promise.all`-wrapped
 * chunked findMany reads (one per `MeasurementType`) so it can hand
 * each series to `summarize()` for slope7/30/90 + anomaly detection +
 * lastMonth/lastYear means. The dashboard tile strip only consumes
 * `count`, `latest`, `avg7`, `avg30`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, and the
 * three slope tuples — every other field gets `null`-coalesced before
 * it ever paints — yet the user waits on the full chunked walk.
 *
 * Read shape (v1.4.36)
 * --------------------
 * v1.4.35 partially read-swapped onto the persistent `measurement_rollups`
 * table but kept the full-fat `$queryRaw` running in parallel as a
 * parity check. The heavy COUNT/MIN/MAX/AVG aggregate scanned the
 * measurements table every request even on warm rollups.
 *
 * v1.4.36 promotes the rollup table to the canonical source on the
 * happy path: a single cheap COUNT against `measurement_rollups`
 * decides whether to read the composable stats from buckets or fall
 * back to the heavy live aggregate. When the rollup is populated:
 *
 *   1. **DAY-bucket read** — composes `count / min / max / mean` per
 *      type via `aggregateBuckets`. The four are linearly composable
 *      across DAY buckets so the composed value is mathematically
 *      identical to the live aggregate over the same rows.
 *
 *   2. **Narrow `$queryRaw`** — carries only the non-composable
 *      windowed columns (`avg7`, `avg30`, and the slope tuples). The
 *      heavy COUNT/MIN/MAX/AVG columns are NOT projected.
 *
 *   3. **`DISTINCT ON (type)` latest read** — most-recent `(type,
 *      value, measured_at)` triplet per type for the `latest` field
 *      and the `lastSeenByType` freshness map.
 *
 * On the cold fallback (no rollup rows yet) the slim slice runs the
 * legacy heavy aggregate so the response shape is correct on the very
 * first request.
 *
 * Fields the slim shape intentionally omits (the dashboard never
 * reads them on first paint):
 *   - `anomalyCount`: would require an extra per-type read for the
 *     z-score loop. The Coach / insights paths still get it via the
 *     default slice.
 *   - `avg30LastMonth` / `avg30LastYear`: the dashboard tile delta
 *     callout uses them, but only when the comparison-baseline
 *     widget is enabled — that path already pre-fetches the default
 *     slice via the explicit comparison opt-in.
 *
 * Slope `confidence` is the SQL `regr_r2` value (R²) which matches
 * the existing `trendSlope()` helper's `Math.round(rSquared * 100) /
 * 100`. Slope `direction` is derived from `slope`'s sign with the
 * same 0.01-units-per-day "stable" threshold the JS helper uses.

 * v1.4.48 — split into two parallel queries:
 *
 *   1. `allTime` — the linearly composable columns (`count / min /
 *      max / mean`) keep the full-partition scan because they must
 *      reflect every row the user has ever logged. No `measured_at`
 *      cap.
 *
 *   2. `windowed` — `avg7 / avg30` and the slope/r² tuples are all
 *      already filtered to a 7/30/90 day window inside the SELECT.
 *      Adding an outer `measured_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'`
 *      cap lets the planner do an index range scan on
 *      `(user_id, type, measured_at)` instead of a full-partition
 *      sequential scan and discarding 95 % of rows inside FILTER
 *      clauses. On tenants with large measurement partitions the
 *      cold fallback drops from multi-second to sub-second. Output is
 *      bit-identical because every row excluded by the new outer cap
 *      was already aggregating to NULL inside its FILTER clause.

/**
 * v1.4.39 W-WMY — long-window summary for a single `(userId, type)`
 * pair, served from the WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rollup tier when the
 * window justifies it.
 *
 * Why this helper exists
 * ----------------------
 * The slim `computeSummariesSlice` caps its windowed columns at 90 d
 * (`slope7 / slope30 / slope90`). The v1.5 multi-year trend feature
 * + the Coach drawer's "history" tile need linearly composable stats
 * (count / min / max / mean / sum) over much larger windows — 1 y,
 * 2 y, 3 y. Hitting the live `measurements` table for a 3-year span
 * walks every row the user has ever logged for that type, which on
 * Marc's tenant is tens of thousands of rows per type.
 *
 * The WMY rollup tier already carries the per-bucket stats we need:
 * the writer mints WEEK / MONTH / YEAR buckets via pg-boss on every
 * measurement write and the boot backfill fills the long tail. This
 * helper routes the requested window into the largest granularity
 * that still resolves it (via `readBestGranularityRollups`) and
 * composes the trailing-window aggregate in JS — typically 3-15
 * bucket rows on a multi-year window, vs the thousands of raw rows
 * the live aggregator would scan.
 *
 * Compositional caveats
 * ---------------------
 * `count / min / max / mean / sum` are mathematically exact across
 * any granularity (linearly composable). `sd / slope / r2` are NOT
 * exact across coarser buckets — this helper deliberately omits them
 * so callers cannot accidentally consume stale slope data. The v1.5
 * multi-year trend card derives its slope from the per-bucket `mean`
 * series instead.
 *
 * Coverage-miss policy
 * --------------------
 * `readBestGranularityRollups` falls back from YEAR → MONTH → WEEK
 * → DAY on per-tier coverage miss. Returns `null` only when the
 * user has zero buckets in the entire window — the caller treats
 * that as "no data" rather than "stale rollup". The route is
 * intentionally NOT wired to live SQL fallback here; the all-time
 * aggregate path inside `computeSummariesSlice` already covers the
 * "rollup tier empty" cold-mount case, and v1.5's multi-year card
 * accepts a `null` "no data yet" state.
 */

/**
 * v1.4.40 W-WMY-WIRE — year-ago 30-day baseline per type, served from
 * the WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rollup tier.
 *
 * Why this helper exists
 * ----------------------
 * `DataSummary.avg30LastYear` is the mean over `[now-395d, now-365d)` —
 * the 30-day window starting 365 days ago. The dashboard tile-strip's
 * delta callout uses it to narrate "current avg vs same time last
 * year". Up to v1.4.39 the slim slice (and the comprehensive
 * aggregator's rollup branch) hardcoded the field to `null` because
 * the 90-day windowed `$queryRaw` cannot reach back a year, and the
 * live `measurements` table walk for a 395-day per-type window is
 * exactly the cold-path cost we're trying to avoid.
 *
 * The WMY rollup tier already carries the per-bucket stats this
 * window needs. `readBestGranularityRollups(userId, type, 395)`
 * routes the 395-day window through YEAR (if covered) → MONTH → WEEK
 * → DAY and returns the buckets whose `bucketStart` falls inside the
 * window. We then keep only the buckets that overlap the
 * `[now-395d, now-365d)` slice and compose `count / mean` linearly to
 * produce the year-ago baseline.
 *
 * Compositional contract
 * ----------------------
 * `count / mean` are linearly composable across any granularity, so
 * the year-ago mean derived from MONTH or YEAR buckets is
 * mathematically equivalent to the per-row average over the same
 * window. The bucket-overlap filter is conservative: we include only
 * buckets whose `bucketStart` is strictly inside the slice. On a
 * YEAR-granularity routing this collapses to at most one bucket and
 * approximates the 30-day mean by the surrounding yearly average —
 * acceptable for a UI hint that explicitly narrates "last year".
 *
 * Coverage-miss policy
 * --------------------
 * Returns `null` when `readBestGranularityRollups` returns null (no
 * coverage at any granularity) OR when no buckets overlap the
 * year-ago slice. The caller leaves the dashboard field as `null`,
 * which the UI already handles as "no comparison available".
