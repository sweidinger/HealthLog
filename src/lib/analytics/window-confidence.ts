/**
 * Shared window-confidence helper (v1.17 W1b).
 *
 * Several insight tiles narrate a metric over a fixed trailing window —
 * the BD-Zielbereich tile reports the BP in-target share over the last
 * 90 days, and future tiles (glucose TIR / GMI, sleep efficiency, …)
 * will do the same over their own windows. A static "· 90 T" label is
 * dishonest for a user who has only a few weeks of history or only a
 * handful of readings: the headline reads like a stable quarter-long
 * average when it is really a thin sample.
 *
 * This helper turns a window length + the readings observed inside it
 * into two truthful signals every windowed tile can reuse:
 *
 *   1. `effectiveSpanDays` — the real calendar span of the data, capped
 *      at the window. A user with 23 days of history sees "· 23 T"; once
 *      ~90 days of history exist the span saturates at the window and the
 *      label reads "· 90 T". `null` when the window holds no readings.
 *
 *   2. `sufficient` — `false` when fewer than `MIN_READINGS_FOR_CONFIDENCE`
 *      readings fall in the window. The caller renders a "collecting data"
 *      placeholder instead of a confident percentage, and the Health-Score
 *      pillar treats the metric as absent rather than grading a thin sample.
 *
 * Pure & deterministic so the unit suite can pin both outputs.
 */

/**
 * Minimum readings inside the window before a percentage is trustworthy.

 * suppressed. Five is the same floor the trend cards use before they draw
