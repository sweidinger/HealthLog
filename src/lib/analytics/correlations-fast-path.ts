/**
 * v1.4.37 W2 — probe-gated correlation hypothesis runner.
 *
 * The three pre-defined hypotheses (BP × medication compliance, mood ×
 * resting pulse, weight × weekday) need PAIRED day-level samples
 * across two streams. The pairing logic is not linearly composable
 * from DAY rollup buckets the way `count / min / max / mean` is, but
 * the only inputs the runners consume from the measurement stream are
 * **per-day means** for the three measurement types (SYS, PULSE,
 * WEIGHT). The rollup table carries those means as a first-class
 * column — when DAY-bucket coverage is present we can hydrate the
 * per-day-mean maps directly from `measurement_rollups` and skip the
 * raw chunked findMany walks against `measurements` entirely.
 *
 * Read shape (v1.4.37)
 * --------------------
 *   1. **Tightened window** — the previous helper read the trailing 30
 *      days. The v1.4.37 helper reads **28 days**. The Pearson +
 *      ANOVA runners require `n >= 20` paired samples (v1.4.23 H6) so
 *      28 still satisfies the surface gate; the 2-day tighten removes
 *      ~7 % of the cold-pool read volume and lines the correlation
 *      window up with the dashboard's "trailing 4 weeks" tile shorthand.
 *      The meta-dict annotate carries `window_days: 28` as a sentinel
 *      so the UI / docs can quote the truthful window.
 *
 *   2. **Probe-gated SYS / WEIGHT** — when DAY-bucket coverage exists
 *      for both types the runner hydrates the per-day-mean / per-day
 *      weight maps from `measurement_rollups`. Each rollup row already
 *      carries the day's `mean` value computed by Postgres' `AVG`, so
 *      the pairing logic is byte-for-byte identical to the live path's
 *      "average the day's raw values" step. PULSE is intentionally NOT
 *      hydrated from the rollup tier — the mood × resting-pulse
 *      hypothesis scores the RESTING series (RESTING_HEART_RATE rows,
 *      else a low-percentile RAW-PULSE proxy), never the day-mean.
 *
 *   3. **Mood + medication intake + resting pulse** — no rollup equivalent today; both
 *      reads stay live regardless of coverage. The mood read is small
 *      (per-day entries, bounded by the 28-day window) and the
 *      medication intake read scales with active medications × 28 days
 *      so neither dominates the cost.
 *
 *   4. **Best-effort sentinel** — the route surface advertises a
 *      28-day correlation window. Older data (> 28 days) is
 *      intentionally NOT scanned on the cold critical path. The
 *      runner emits `degraded: false` on the happy path; downstream
 *      consumers can extend the window via a separate dedicated
 *      endpoint when richer historical context is needed.
