/**
 * v1.11.4 — per-night sleep aggregation (iOS #1, HIGH).
 *
 * `SLEEP_DURATION` is stored in MINUTES, one row per sleep STAGE per
 * night (IN_BED / AWAKE / ASLEEP / REM / CORE / DEEP) since v1.4.23. The
 * value is NOT cumulative — a single stage row carries only that stage's
 * minutes. Every "last night's sleep" surface therefore has to SUM the
 * stage rows belonging to one night before it shows a headline number;
 * reading the single most-recent row gives one stage, not the night.
 *
 * This helper is the one shared place that turns the raw per-stage rows
 * into per-night totals. The headline "time asleep" is light(CORE) +
 * deep + REM; IN_BED and AWAKE are excluded from the asleep total,
 * matching the AASM convention.
 *
 * Granular-over-bare (v1.11.5)
 * ----------------------------
 * Apple Health writes BOTH an unspecified `ASLEEP` AGGREGATE row AND the
 * granular `CORE` / `DEEP` / `REM` breakdown for the SAME sleep period. The
 * granular rows partition the same time the aggregate covers, so counting
 * bare-ASLEEP together with the granular rows ~doubles the night. We therefore
 * prefer the granular partition: when ANY granular stage (CORE / DEEP / REM)
 * is present for a session we drop the redundant bare `ASLEEP` aggregate (and
 * any stage-less row) EVERYWHERE — the asleep total, the per-stage `stages`
 * breakdown, and the hypnogram `segments` list — so none of those views holds
 * the granular set plus its ~equal bare twin. The bare `ASLEEP` aggregate (or
 * a stage-less legacy / manual row) is the session's only asleep signal when
 * no granular stage exists. WHOOP never emits a bare `ASLEEP` aggregate (its
 * stage map writes CORE / DEEP / REM / AWAKE / IN_BED only — see
 * `whoop/client.ts`), so this gate is Apple-Health-only in practice.
 *
 * Night grouping
 * --------------
 * A "night" is one SLEEP SESSION, not a calendar day. `measuredAt` is the
 * stage segment's END instant (`apple-health-mapping.ts` sets
 * `takenAt = endDate`), and a device writes one row per stage segment, so a
 * normal overnight sleep (asleep before local midnight) spreads its segments
 * across BOTH sides of midnight. Keying each segment by its own calendar day
 * would split one physical night into two partial nights and undercount the
 * "last night" headline.
 *
 * Instead we cluster the segments into sessions by time gap: sort by
 * `measuredAt`, and start a new session whenever the gap from the previous
 * segment exceeds `SESSION_GAP_MS` (3 h). Stage segments inside one sleep
 * session are contiguous (minutes to ~2 h apart), so a > 3 h gap reliably
 * marks the boundary between a daytime nap and the overnight session, or
 * between two genuine sessions in one day — they stay separable. The gap is
 * measured on the absolute UTC instant, so it is immune to DST shifts.
 *
 * Each session is keyed by the LOCAL WAKE DAY — `userDayKey` of the session's
 * LAST segment (its end instant) in the user's timezone. This matches the
 * Apple Health convention (a sleep session is attributed to the date you wake
 * up) and keeps the keying tz/DST-correct because it runs on the real instant.
 *
 * Naps vs the main night
 * ----------------------
 * `reconstructSleepNights` MERGES every session that lands on the same wake
 * day under one key so the headline "time asleep" for a day is the day's
 * total. `reconstructSleepSessions` keeps each session SEPARATE, and
 * `pickMainNightAndNaps` applies the convention the UI needs: the MAIN night
 * is the session with the most asleep minutes (normally the overnight block),
 * and every other session on the same wake day is a NAP, surfaced separately
 * and never folded into the main night's headline.
 *
 * Writer de-dup
 * -------------
 * A user paired to more than one sleep source (e.g. WHOOP + Apple Health)
 * gets per-stage rows for the SAME night from each source. Summing them all
 * would ~double the night total. Before summing a session we collapse it to
 * ONE writer. A "writer" is `(source, deviceType)` — finer than `source`
 * because several HealthKit writer apps land behind the SAME
 * `source = APPLE_HEALTH` (the watch's granular stages, the phone's coarse
 * in-bed detection, a wearable vendor app's re-export). Keying the collapse
 * on source alone blends those writers into one bucket: the phone's
 * awake/in-bed blocks inflate the night's awake total and sit on top of the
 * watch's hypnogram. Rows without a `deviceType` collapse per source exactly
 * as before, so legacy rows and single-writer sources are unaffected.
 *
 * The pick is per-night by STAGE RICHNESS first: the writer carrying the
 * most distinct granular stages (CORE / DEEP / REM) wins, so a coarse
 * awake/asleep-only export can never mask a writer that knows the night's
 * phases. Among equally rich writers the user's `sleep` source-priority
 * ladder decides (`DEFAULT_SOURCE_PRIORITY.sleep` = WHOOP > APPLE_HEALTH >
 * WITHINGS), then most asleep minutes, then a stable key tiebreak. Only the
 * winning writer's segments are summed — writers are never blended within a
 * session, mirroring the per-(type, day) collapse the rest of the v1.11.x
 * numeric surfaces apply.
 *
 * One exception: `inBedMinutes` ("Zeit im Bett") derives from the UNION
 * of the IN_BED spans across ALL writers in the session, not from the
 * winner alone. The common pairing is a watch that knows the stages but
 * writes no IN_BED row and a phone whose bedtime detection writes only
 * the long IN_BED window — the watch wins the night on richness, and a
 * winner-only in-bed figure would shrink to nothing exactly when the
 * stage data is best. Overlapping spans from two writers are merged
 * interval-union style so a doubled export never double-counts. The
 * asleep total, the `stages` map, and `awakeMinutes` stay winner-only —
 * blending the phone's coarse AWAKE blocks into the watch's night was
 * the original inflated-awake bug this collapse exists to prevent.
 *
 * Unit
 * ----
 * Totals are returned in MINUTES — the canonical `SLEEP_DURATION` unit
 * (`getUnitForType` → "minutes") — so the existing web consumers that
 * already treat the summary as minutes (e.g. the insights overview's
 * `formatHoursMinutes`) keep working unchanged; they now average per-
 * night totals instead of per-stage rows, which is strictly more
 * correct. Callers that want hours convert at the edge (`/ 60`).
