/**
 * v1.5.0 — canonical recurrence engine for medication scheduling.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "what dose slots does this schedule emit
 * between A and B?" The canonical engine is introduced in this release;
 * the v1.5.0 cut wires only the reminder worker (via
 * `worker-helpers.ts`) through it. The today-projector
 * (`expandTodayIntakes`), the cadence chart (`expandScheduleSlots`),
 * and the form-level helpers continue on the legacy walker through
 * v1.5.x and migrate per the read-flip plan. The medication card's
 * "next intake" line reads the server-computed `nextDueAt` (this engine
 * via `computeNextDueAt`) directly as of v1.8.4.
 *
 * Dispatch tiers (first matching tier wins):
 *
 *   1. **One-shot** (`medication.oneShot === true`) — single slot at
 *      the anchor date, one per `timesOfDay` entry.
 *   2. **Rolling** (`schedule.rollingIntervalDays !== null`) — next
 *      slot is `lastIntakeAt + N days`. With no intake yet the FIRST
 *      dose is due AT `startsOn ?? createdAt` (not `+ N`); the `+ N`
 *      cadence only begins once the first intake is logged. Only the
 *      immediately next slot is emitted; further slots depend on the
 *      user actually logging the intake.
 *   3. **RRULE** (`schedule.rrule !== null`) — RFC 5545 expansion
 *      via the `rrule` npm lib. Day-anchored dates are returned in
 *      UTC by the library; each `timesOfDay` entry is then applied
 *      to that day in the user's IANA timezone (DST-aware via
 *      `wallClockInTz`).
 *   4. **Legacy fallback** — both `rrule` and `rollingIntervalDays`
 *      are NULL and `oneShot` is false. Decodes the legacy
 *      `daysOfWeek` string via `parseScheduleRecurrence` and emits
 *      weekly slots. **Honours `intervalWeeks > 1` correctly** —
 *      the existing `expandTodayIntakes` skipped it (the legacy
 *      bi-weekly worker bug R-3 finding 5 calls out); this engine
 *      anchors the week phase to `startsOn ?? createdAt` and emits
 *      on the matching weeks only.
 *
 * Pure functions, no DB access. Caller fetches `lastIntakeAt`
 * (latest `MedicationIntakeEvent.takenAt`) and threads it through
 * `RecurrenceContext`.
 *
 * **As-needed medications (v1.16.11, #316).** A medication with
 * `Medication.asNeeded = true` carries ZERO schedule rows (enforced at
 * the create/update routes), so this engine is never consulted for it:
 * `computeNextDueAt` / `computeDisplayDue` return null on an empty
 * schedule list by construction, the reminder worker iterates no
 * schedules, the projector mints no slots, and compliance expands no
 * expected doses. The MEDICATION_LOW_STOCK runway is likewise null (no
 * consuming schedule) — that is correct and intended: an as-needed
 * supply is not falling on a predictable cadence, so no runway-based
 * alert can be honest. Intakes for such medications are ad-hoc rows
 * (`scheduledFor = takenAt`, the documented standalone-insert
 * contract); the schedule-level `scheduleType = "PRN"` early-returns
 * below are the per-schedule prior art for the same semantics.

 *   - No intake yet → the FIRST dose is due AT `startsOn ?? createdAt`,

 * which must reconstruct the *historical* expected-dose slots a rolling
 * cadence implies over a trailing window so a faithfully-adherent weekly
 * injection reads its true rate instead of the vacuous 100%-or-0% flip
 * the forward-only path produced.
 *
 * Medically-correct reading: a rolling "every N days from last dose"
 * cadence re-anchors on each intake, so the retrospective expected grid
 * *is* the observed intake history (each logged dose is exactly one
 * satisfied expected slot) PLUS:
 *
 *   - back-filled `missed` slots for genuinely skipped whole cycles: when
 *     two consecutive intakes are more than `1.5 · N` apart the user
 *     skipped one or more cycles → emit a slot at `prevIntake + k·N` for
 *     each whole cycle the gap spans (the `1.5·N` tolerance gate means a
 *     dose logged a day late never synthesizes a phantom miss); and
 *   - the single forward next-due slot, emitted ONLY when it is past-due
 *     (`nextDue ≤ now`). A not-yet-due forward slot is `upcoming` and is
 *     excluded so the open current cycle never counts against the
 *     denominator.
 *
 * Because the back-filled / forward slots carry no nearby intake, they
 * pair to nothing in `pairDoses` and read `missed`; the per-intake slots
 * are anchored AT the intake instant so they pair (distance 0) and read
 * `taken`. The same grid feeds the count-only callers
 * (`expectedSlotsBetween` / `expectedSlotCountForDay`) so numerator,
 * denominator, and the heatmap `due` flags route through ONE expansion
 * (the v1.7.3 B15 numerator/denominator-convergence rule).
 *
 * Kept here (not folded into `expandRolling`) so the engine's forward
 * contract is untouched; compliance opts in explicitly via
 * `expandRollingRetrospective`.
 *

 *   (ascending or unsorted — sorted internally). The compliance layer
