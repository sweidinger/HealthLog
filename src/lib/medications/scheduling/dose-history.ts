/**
 * v1.15.18 — traceable dose-history reconstruction (spec B).
 *
 * Builds a complete, attributable ledger for a medication's day(s): every
 * expected slot with a status, plus every off-schedule intake tagged ad-hoc.
 * It is the read-model behind the medication history view + the card's
 * last/next dose, and it converges forward over legacy mis-snapped rows
 * because it attributes a TAKEN intake by its real `takenAt`, not the stored
 * `scheduledFor` the old write path may have snapped to a slot.
 *
 * Attribution rules:
 *   - skipped / auto-missed / pending rows (no `takenAt`) bind to the slot
 *     whose anchor equals their `scheduledFor` (±epsilon): these were written
 *     against a slot deliberately, so they annotate that slot. A pending row
 *     (neither skipped nor auto-missed) is status-derived by time — missed
 *     only past the slot's miss cutoff, upcoming until then — and a pending
 *     row matching no band at all is dropped (server-minted placeholder for
 *     a slot outside the queried window, not a user action);
 *   - a TAKEN intake is attributed by `attributeIntakeToSlot(takenAt, bands)`;
 *     inside a band → that slot (on-time / late), outside every band → ad-hoc;
 *   - a TAKEN intake the user PINNED onto a slot (`pinned`, v1.15.20 —
 *     `attributionSource = USER_PIN`) binds by its `scheduledFor` anchor like
 *     a skip, NOT by takenAt-band membership, so a pin outside the late tail
 *     never degrades back to ad-hoc. Status is `taken_late` unless the
 *     takenAt happens to sit inside the slot's on-time band — a pin can
 *     never flatter the timing;
 *   - each slot is claimed by at most one intake (first/best wins); extra
 *     intakes near a filled slot fall through to ad-hoc.
 *
 * Pure / synchronous / instant-based — the caller mints the bands DST-correctly
 * via `localHmAsUtc` and supplies the per-dose window.
