/**
 * v1.4.25 W19e — pure cadence helpers for the medication detail page.
 *
 * Reads existing `MedicationSchedule` rows (`windowStart`, `windowEnd`,
 * `daysOfWeek` encoded via `serializeScheduleRecurrence`) plus the
 * recorded `MedicationIntakeEvent` stream, projects an expected-dose
 * timeline over a configurable window, and pairs each expected dose
 * with the closest actual intake (if any).
 *
 * No DB access here — every function takes pre-fetched rows. The API
 * route owns the prisma queries; this module owns the math. Same
 * shape as the W19d side-effects pure helpers.
 *
 * Why we do this client-side / server-side both: the section card on
 * the detail page renders a 30-day mini-chart; the same math feeds
 * the API JSON that drives the Compliance chips. Sharing one pure
 * module keeps the two surfaces from drifting.
 *
 * v1.4.25 W21 Fix-O — the local-day boundary helpers accept an
 * optional IANA `timeZone` argument (`Europe/Berlin`, `Asia/Tokyo`,
 * …). When supplied, every day/week boundary and every `HH:mm`
 * window-application is interpreted in the user's zone via
 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat` rather than the host's system time. The
 * cadence route resolves the zone through `resolveUserTimezone()`
 * and threads it through every helper. Omitting the argument falls
 * back to system-local — the legacy single-tz behaviour the v1.4.25
 * W19e tests pin.
