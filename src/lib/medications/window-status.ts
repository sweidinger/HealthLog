/**
 * v1.4.37 W4b — shared current-window status helper for medication
 * detail cards.
 *
 * Both the generic `<MedicationCard>` and the GLP-1 variant
 * (`<Glp1MedicationCard>`) need to paint the same coloured "take now /
 * overdue / very overdue" pill at the top of their detail surface. The
 * logic was historically inlined in the generic card only, which produced
 * a visible asymmetry between the two variants (v1.4.37 UX audit item 11).
 *
 * Lifting the schedule-window math into one helper guarantees both card
 * variants stay byte-equivalent for the status row — same thresholds,
 * same in-window / late / very-late tiering, same overnight-window
 * handling, same "don't show in-window if last intake already covered
 * this window today" guard. The GLP-1 schedule shape carries the same
 * `windowStart` / `windowEnd` / `daysOfWeek` fields as the generic
 * schedule, so the helper accepts any schedule that satisfies the
 * minimal `ScheduleWindowInput` shape.
 *
 * v1.16.1 — the dose-band model becomes the canonical source. When a
 * schedule carries `timesOfDay`, every status decision derives from
 * per-dose on-time bands — the explicit `doseWindows` entry for the
 * matching dose when present, else `timeOfDay ±` the default daily
 * on-time half-width. The legacy `windowStart` / `windowEnd` pair is
 * consulted ONLY for rows without `timesOfDay`; a stale or degenerate
 * window (e.g. `07:00 / 07:00` left behind by an old write path while
 * the times moved to `09:00 / 21:00`) can no longer paint a take-now
 * pill at 07:00 or mis-anchor the recorded slot. The matched band rides
 * on the result (`window`) so the pill text and the displayed-slot
 * resolution read the SAME band the status came from.
 *
 * v1.15.20 — three model fixes (kept):
 *   - the wall-clock conversion takes the user's IANA timezone (default
 *     `Europe/Berlin` so existing call sites compile + behave unchanged;
 *     threading the real user timezone through the cards is the follow-up);
 *   - a degenerate `windowStart === windowEnd` schedule (a single dose
 *     time echoed into both fields) is a POINT window widened by the
 *     default daily on-time half-width — it previously fell into the
 *     overnight branch and read as a 24 h always-in-window band;
 *   - passed-dose counting counts the schedule's `timesOfDay` doses, not
 *     schedule rows, so a two-dose row ("08:00" + "20:00") expects two
 *     intake events before the overdue pill is suppressed.
