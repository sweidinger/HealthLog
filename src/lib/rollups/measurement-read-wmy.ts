/**
 * v1.4.39 W-WMY — WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rollup readers.
 *
 * Background — the read-side gap
 * ------------------------------
 * Every measurement write fans out via `recomputeBucketsForMeasurement`
 * into a synchronous DAY upsert plus pg-boss-queued WEEK / MONTH / YEAR
 * recomputes. The boot-time backfill (`enqueueBootTimeRollupBackfill`)
 * mints the full WEEK / MONTH / YEAR history once per uncovered user.
 *
 * As of v1.4.38 the only reader that consults `measurement_rollups`
 * (`rollup-read.ts`, plus the per-fast-path branches in
 * `summaries-slice`, `comprehensive-aggregator`, etc.) caps at DAY and
 * a trailing 90-day window. The WEEK / MONTH / YEAR buckets sit in
 * Postgres as pure write amplification — populated every write,
 * surfaced nowhere on read. The v1.4.38 perf audit
 * (`.planning/round-v1438-perf-analysis.md` §2 + §5 P6) calls this out
 * as the largest unused investment in the rollup tier.
 *
 * What this module adds
 * ---------------------
 * Helpers that read the trailing N-bucket window for a single
 * `(userId, type)` pair at a chosen granularity, plus an auto-router
 * that picks the largest granularity that still resolves the requested
 * window. The shape returned is identical to `readRollupBuckets` so
 * callers can interleave WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rows with DAY rows
 * downstream without branching on the source granularity.
 *
 * Compositional contract
 * ----------------------
 * `count / min / max / mean / sumValue` are linearly composable across
 * any granularity — aggregating these stats over WEEK buckets returns
 * the same numbers as aggregating the underlying DAY buckets or the
 * raw measurements. `sd / slope / r2` are NOT linearly composable; the
 * routed callers either fall back to live SQL for those or accept the
 * per-bucket stat as-is. The auto-router is a granularity selector
 * only — it does not attempt to reconstruct slope across coarser
 * buckets.
 *
 * Coverage-miss semantics
 * -----------------------
 * Each reader returns `null` when the requested granularity yields
 * zero rows for `(userId, type, since)`. The caller decides whether
 * that is a real "no data" case (the user has not logged this type in
 * the window) or a coverage miss the boot-backfill / worker has not
 * caught up on. The default policy is to fall back to a finer
 * granularity (MONTH → WEEK → DAY) before giving up — see
 * `readBestGranularityRollups`.
 *
 * Scope vs. `rollup-read.ts`
 * --------------------------
 * `rollup-read.ts` carries the existing DAY-only aggregator. This
 * module is deliberately separate so the WEEK / MONTH / YEAR wiring
 * is reviewable in isolation and so the v1.4.39 W-SUM agent's
 * concurrent edits to the writer side don't collide with the reader
 * additions.

 *
 *   - DAY     → any window — 90 daily buckets for a 90-day window
 *               is already trivially cheap and the trend resolution
 *               is canonical
 *   - WEEK    → > 90 days (~13 weekly buckets for a quarter)

 *               from DAY-bucket granularity than coarse-grained
 *               averaging)

 * The floors are conservative on purpose — coarser tiers only
 * activate when the row-count savings actually justify trading the

 * v1.19.2 — whole-history series reader for very long chart ranges.
 *
 * The DAY-only `readDailySeries` reader caps its result at
 * `BUCKET_CAP.daily` (365) buckets. A multi-year "Alle" range therefore
 * silently truncated to roughly the most recent year — the older history
 * never reached the client even though the chart's own
 * `bucketTimeSeries` downsampler would have rendered it as week / month
 * points. This reader closes that gap by reading the bucket tier that
 * matches the chart's display granularity (WEEK for 1–2 years, MONTH
 * beyond), so the returned series spans the WHOLE requested window inside
 * a sane point budget instead of being chopped to a recent slice.
 *
 * The tier is purely a downsampling choice: `count` and the
 * count-weighted `mean` compose identically across any granularity (see
 * the compositional contract above), so a 5-year window rendered as ~60
 * MONTH points carries the same trend as the ~1 800 DAY points would have
 * — minus the truncation. `minValue` / `maxValue` ride through for the
 * range band on spot metrics; cumulative metrics (steps, energy,
 * distance) surface the bucket's summed total and drop the spread.
 *
 * Coverage handling: the target tier is read first; on a coverage miss
 * (the boot backfill / worker has not minted the coarse buckets yet) the
 * reader walks FINER (MONTH → WEEK → DAY) so a tenant still gets a usable
 * series rather than an empty chart. Returns `null` only when no tier at
 * or below the target carries any buckets for the window — the caller
 * then falls through to its live-SQL path.
 *
 * The result is NOT capped — the tier selection bounds the row count
 * (≤ ~104 weeks for the WEEK tier, ≤ ~12 months/year for MONTH). If a
 * future tier ever risks an unbounded count it must step coarser rather
 * than truncate; no silent cap lives on this path.
 *
 * v1.26.0 SEAM-N2 — the reader is bounded to the REQUESTED `[from, to]`
 * window on BOTH ends, not a trailing "now − windowDays … now" slice.
 * The caller passes arbitrary ISO instants (a historic "All" range whose
 * `to` need not be ≈ now), so anchoring on `Date.now()` returned the wrong
 * buckets entirely. The tier SELECTION still keys off the window WIDTH
 * (`windowDays`, derived from the span) — only the window the tier READS
 * changed. This matches the DAY-tier `readRollup` + the live-SQL
 * `readLiveDaily` fallback, both of which bound on `[from, to]`.
