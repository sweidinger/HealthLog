/**
 * v1.4.39 W-WMY — WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rollup readers.
 *
 * Background — the read-side gap
 * ------------------------------
 * Every measurement write fans out via `recomputeBucketsForMeasurement`
 * into a synchronous DAY upsert plus pg-boss-queued WEEK / MONTH / YEAR
 * recomputes. The boot-time backfill (`enqueueBootTimeRollupBackfill`)
 * mints the full WEEK / MONTH / YEAR history once per uncovered user.
 *
 * As of v1.4.38 the only reader that consults `measurement_rollups`
 * (`rollup-read.ts`, plus the per-fast-path branches in
 * `summaries-slice`, `comprehensive-aggregator`, etc.) caps at DAY and
 * a trailing 90-day window. The WEEK / MONTH / YEAR buckets sit in
 * Postgres as pure write amplification — populated every write,
 * surfaced nowhere on read. The v1.4.38 perf audit
 * (`.planning/round-v1438-perf-analysis.md` §2 + §5 P6) calls this out
 * as the largest unused investment in the rollup tier.
 *
 * What this module adds
 * ---------------------
 * Helpers that read the trailing N-bucket window for a single
 * `(userId, type)` pair at a chosen granularity, plus an auto-router
 * that picks the largest granularity that still resolves the requested
 * window. The shape returned is identical to `readRollupBuckets` so
 * callers can interleave WEEK / MONTH / YEAR rows with DAY rows
 * downstream without branching on the source granularity.
 *
 * Compositional contract
 * ----------------------
 * `count / min / max / mean / sumValue` are linearly composable across
 * any granularity — aggregating these stats over WEEK buckets returns
 * the same numbers as aggregating the underlying DAY buckets or the
 * raw measurements. `sd / slope / r2` are NOT linearly composable; the
 * routed callers either fall back to live SQL for those or accept the
 * per-bucket stat as-is. The auto-router is a granularity selector
 * only — it does not attempt to reconstruct slope across coarser
 * buckets.
 *
 * Coverage-miss semantics
 * -----------------------
 * Each reader returns `null` when the requested granularity yields
 * zero rows for `(userId, type, since)`. The caller decides whether
 * that is a real "no data" case (the user has not logged this type in
 * the window) or a coverage miss the boot-backfill / worker has not
 * caught up on. The default policy is to fall back to a finer
 * granularity (MONTH → WEEK → DAY) before giving up — see
 * `readBestGranularityRollups`.
 *
 * Scope vs. `rollup-read.ts`
 * --------------------------
 * `rollup-read.ts` carries the existing DAY-only aggregator. This
 * module is deliberately separate so the WEEK / MONTH / YEAR wiring
 * is reviewable in isolation and so the v1.4.39 W-SUM agent's
 * concurrent edits to the writer side don't collide with the reader
 * additions.

 * Per-granularity "this is the smallest window the granularity can

 *
 *   - DAY     → any window — 90 daily buckets for a 90-day window
 *               is already trivially cheap and the trend resolution
 *               is canonical
 *   - WEEK    → > 90 days (~13 weekly buckets for a quarter)
 *   - MONTH   → > 180 days (~6 monthly buckets, enough trend signal
 *               for a half-year view; smaller windows benefit more
 *               from DAY-bucket granularity than coarse-grained
 *               averaging)
 *   - YEAR    → > 730 days (≥ 2 yearly buckets — anything below 2 y
 *               collapses to one bucket and carries no slope signal)
 *
 * The pinned routing the v1.5 multi-year trend card relies on:
 *   90 d → DAY   (90 buckets)
 *   365 d → MONTH (12 buckets)
 *   1095 d → YEAR (3 buckets)
 *
 * The floors are conservative on purpose — coarser tiers only
 * activate when the row-count savings actually justify trading the
 * finer trend resolution.
