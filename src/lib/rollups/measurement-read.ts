/**
 * v1.5.0 — read-side helpers that aggregate the persistent rollup
 * table into the same `DataSummary` shape the live aggregator
 * returns. The reader-side surfaces (`summaries-slice`,
 * `comprehensive-aggregator`, the analytics route) re-aggregate the
 * trailing DAY buckets directly via `readRollupBuckets` and feed the
 * resulting rows into `aggregateBuckets` below.
 *
 * The 90-day window is reconstructed from DAY buckets by:
 *   - sum(count_i)              → window count
 *   - min(min_i)                → window min
 *   - max(max_i)                → window max
 *   - sum(count_i × mean_i) / Σcount_i → window mean (weighted by daily count)
 *
 * That re-aggregation is mathematically exact for `count`, `min`,
 * `max`, and `mean` — they are linearly composable across DAY buckets.
 * SD / slope / R² are NOT exact: aggregating across DAY buckets is not
 * the same as the population stats over the raw rows. For those, the
 * rollup-read path delegates to live SQL so the byte-shape parity with
 * the v1.4.34.1 / 4.5 aggregator survives.

 * v1.11.1 — collapse per-source rollup rows to ONE row per bucket using the
 * user's source-priority ladder. The writer mints one row per
 * (type, day, source); this resolves overlapping sources (e.g. WHOOP + Apple
 * Watch resting heart rate) to the ladder-canonical reading before the linear
 * composition in `aggregateBuckets` / the WMY readers runs. Cumulative types
 * collapse to the single canonical source too, so the caller reads that one
 * source's summed `sumValue` — a day's total reflects one source, never a
 * cross-source sum.
 *
 * Resolution per bucket:
 *   1. the first source in the metric's ladder that is present → canonical;
 *   2. no ladder match (an unlisted source, or a type with no ladder) → the
 *      row with the most readings (max `count`), tie-broken by source name,
 *      so the bucket neither doubles nor goes dark.
 *
 * Input order is preserved (buckets emit in first-seen order). A single-source
 * day (the common case) short-circuits to the row unchanged.
