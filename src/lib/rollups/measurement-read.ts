 * Raw epoch-days sit at x ≈ 20 540, so `x²` lands near 4.2e8 and `Σxx`

 * v1.20.0 F6 — compose a windowed OLS slope / r² / population-sd from the
 * summed regression accumulators of a set of DAY buckets.
 *
 * The six terms (`n = Σcount`, `Σx`, `Σy`, `Σxy`, `Σxx`, `Σyy`) are ADDITIVE
 * across buckets, so summing the per-bucket accumulators over the window and
 * evaluating the closed form yields a result that matches Postgres
 * `REGR_SLOPE` / `REGR_R2` / `STDDEV_POP` over the same raw rows (Postgres
 * folds the same accumulators).
 *
 * The composition uses the MEAN-CENTERED (corrected-sum) identities rather
 * than the textbook determinant form `n·Σxx − Σx²`:
 *
 *   Sxx    = Σxx − Σx²/n
 *   Sxy    = Σxy − Σx·Σy/n
 *   Syy    = Σyy − Σy²/n
 *   slope  = Sxy / Sxx
 *   r²     = Sxy² / (Sxx·Syy)
 *   sd_pop = sqrt(Syy / n)
 *
 * This is algebraically identical to the determinant form (multiply numerator
 * and denominator by n) and to Postgres' REGR_* / STDDEV_POP, but numerically
 * stable: the centered form subtracts `Σx²/n` from `Σxx` at the same scale per
 * term, so the cancellation is bounded by the true x-variance, not the absolute
 * x magnitude.
 *
 * v1.21.0 — the accumulators are stored REBASED to `REGRESSION_X_ORIGIN_DAYS`
 * (x = epoch_days − origin), so `Σxx` stays O(1e7) instead of O(1e10) and the
 * squared terms never shed precision at write time. Slope / r² / sd are
 * invariant under the x-shift, so this composes the SAME regression the live
 * (un-rebased) REGR_* probe folds — the rebase only restores the bits the raw
 * epoch-day square would have lost. Σy is read from the exact stored `sumValue`
 * accumulator when present (falling back to `mean·count`), removing the
 * AVG→multiply ULP residual on the y side too.
 *
 * The caller MUST collapse overlapping sources to the canonical source
 * BEFORE handing rows here — the accumulators are per-source, so summing a
 * dual-source day's two rows would double-count the reading. Pass the
 * already-source-collapsed bucket set.
 *
 * Coverage contract: returns `{ null, null, null }` (a full miss) when
 *   - any bucket in the window has a `null` accumulator (pre-migration row
 *     the boot re-fold has not refilled), or
 *   - the window holds fewer than 2 readings, or
 *   - a denominator degenerates to 0 (no x-variance / no y-variance).
 *
 * The caller treats a miss as "fall back to live SQL", so a partially
 * back-filled window never silently returns a wrong (partial) regression.
 *
 * Postgres' REGR_SLOPE / REGR_R2 ignore rows with a NULL dependent or
 * independent value; `value` and `measured_at` are NOT NULL on
 * `measurements`, so every raw row contributes and the accumulator `n`
 * equals the live `regr_count`.
