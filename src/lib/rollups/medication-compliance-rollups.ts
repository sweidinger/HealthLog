/**
 * v1.4.39 W-MED — persistent medication-compliance rollup tier.
 *
 * Replaces the unbounded `MedicationIntakeEvent.findMany` walk on
 * `/api/medications/intake?scope=compliance` with a ledger keyed
 * `(userId, medicationId, day)` where `day` is `YYYY-MM-DD` anchored
 * to the user's IANA timezone.
 *
 * Write hooks fire from every `MedicationIntakeEvent` mutation site
 * (create / update / delete / bulk import) plus the reminder-worker's
 * mint path that creates `takenAt:null` rows on RED-phase reminders.
 * Reads collapse the trailing N-day window into a single bounded
 * `findMany` against `medication_compliance_rollups`; the route-level
 * coverage probe falls back to live + fires a boot backfill when a
 * user has intake events but zero rollup rows.
 *
 * v1.15.18 DESIGN DECISION — this tier stays a RAW per-day COVERAGE count,
 * NOT the band-attributed compliance %. It aggregates, across ALL of a
 * user's medications, "of the intake rows whose `scheduled_for` lands on
 * this day, how many carry a non-null `taken_at`" — a coarse daily
 * cross-medication coverage strip for the dashboard mini-tiles. The
 * unified band-membership attribution (the `tallyComplianceFromLedger`
 * keystone) is per-medication and per-cadence: it depends on the slot
 * bands of each schedule and the user timezone, which cannot be expressed
 * in a single cross-medication SQL `SUM(CASE …)`. Re-attributing every
 * intake against its cadence's bands before the tally would mean running
 * the band minter per `(medication, day)` inside the rollup, which defeats
 * the rollup's whole purpose (bounded SQL, no per-row Node walk). The
 * detail page + the medication card already read the band-attributed % via
 * `calculateCompliance` / `complianceChips`; this tier deliberately remains
 * the cheaper coverage signal and is documented as such so the two are not
 * confused. The `scheduled` / `taken` column names reflect this: a day's
 * `taken` is "slots with an intake logged taken", not "doses inside their
 * on-time band".
 *
 * v1.15.19 — the count is SLOT-level, not row-level. The partial unique
 * index on `(user, medication, scheduled_for, source)` lets two live rows
 * share one slot instant when their `source` differs (e.g. a pending
 * REMINDER row plus a taken API row for the same dose); a row-level
 * `COUNT(*)` double-counted that slot as two scheduled doses. The
 * aggregate now groups by `scheduled_for` first: `scheduled` counts
 * distinct slot instants, and each slot folds its rows with
 * taken-beats-skipped priority (`BOOL_OR` of taken, then skipped only when
 * no row in the slot is taken). This neutralises cross-source duplicate
 * rows retroactively — any recompute over pre-existing duplicates yields
 * the deduplicated counts without a data migration.
 *
 * Audit anchor: `.planning/round-v1438-perf-analysis.md` §2.5 + §5 P4.
