/**
 * v1.4.39 W-MOOD — persistent mood-rollup populator.
 *
 * Sits behind the 60-s `caches.moodAnalytics` LRU as the second cache
 * tier on `/api/mood/analytics`. One row per
 * `(userId, granularity, bucketStart)` in `mood_entry_rollups`,
 * carrying `count` / `mean` / `min_score` / `max_score` / `sd`
 * (population) folded via Postgres `AVG` / `MIN` / `MAX` / `STDDEV_POP`.
 *
 * The audit at `.planning/round-v1438-perf-analysis.md` §2.3 traced
 * the 12.7 s cold mount on `/api/mood/analytics` to the unbounded
 * `prisma.moodEntry.findMany({ where: { userId } })` that walked
 * every mood row the user has ever written into Node only to
 * bucket-average them in JS. This module mirrors the well-trodden
 * `src/lib/measurements/rollups.ts` pattern so the read path can swap
 * to a bounded `prisma.moodEntryRollup.findMany` with the daily mean
 * already materialised.
 *
 * Keying (v1.32.12): every bucket is keyed on the canonical per-row
 * `MoodEntry.date` label (minted at write time by `moodDateKey` under
 * the row's own `tz`), NOT the UTC truncation of `mood_logged_at`. The
 * rollup is therefore byte-identical to every live `entry.date`
 * fallback, and a late-evening / after-midnight local mood lands on the
 * calendar day the user logged it in their timezone. `bucket_start`
 * stores that label as its UTC-midnight instant.
 *
 * Write hooks:
 *   - Every mood-entry create/update/delete fires
 *     `recomputeMoodBucketsForEntry(userId, dateLabel)`. The DAY pass
 *     runs inline (cheap — single `(user, day-label)` aggregate) so the
 *     next read sees the fresh row without waiting on pg-boss.
 *   - WEEK / MONTH / YEAR are enqueued onto `mood-rollup-recompute`
 *     for the worker to fold. No current reader consumes them; the
 *     buckets exist so future cross-granularity readers ship without
 *     a backfill step.
 *   - Bulk endpoints (`/api/mood-entries/bulk`, restore) call
 *     `recomputeUserMoodRollups(userId)` once at the end of the
 *     batch instead of firing N per-row hooks.
 *
 * Reads:
 *   - `readMoodDayRollups(userId, since)` returns the persisted DAY
 *     rows. The reader-side fallback in `/api/mood/analytics` checks
 *     the rollup count and falls through to the legacy live findMany
 *     once when the user has mood entries but zero rollup rows;
 *     `enqueueBootTimeMoodRollupBackfill` mints the rollups on the
 *     next worker boot so subsequent reads converge on the fast path.
