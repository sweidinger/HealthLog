 * Exported so the API Zod `tileIdEnum` can be built from a single

 *
 * v1.8.7.1 — the tile-id universe is derived FROM `SUB_PAGE_SLUGS`
 * (`src/lib/insights/sub-page-metric.ts`), the same record the routed

 * a layout covering the full metric set (blood-pressure … skin-
 * temperature) rather than tripping a 422 on the ~25 slugs the layout
 * previously did not know about. `"overview"` is layout-only — it is
 * the mother page, not a sub-page slug — so it is prepended explicitly.
 *
 * v1.8.0 — the canonical ids are English, matching the routed slugs
 * (`/insights/<slug>`) and the naming-convention ADR
 * (`docs/adr/0001-insights-naming-convention.md`). The ids were German
 * through v1.7.x and the iOS layout-sync contract
 * (`GET/PUT /api/insights/layout`) speaks them, so the layout endpoint
 * keeps ACCEPTING the legacy German ids and NORMALISES them to the
 * canonical English ones on both read and write — see
 * `LEGACY_INSIGHTS_TILE_ID_ALIASES` + `normalizeInsightsTileId` below.
 * No client breaks; iOS migrates to the English ids at its own pace.

 * Vitals/Mobility GRID, which renders only a FIXED mapped set of tiles

 * Active-Energy, body composition, Walking/mobility, Audio, Daylight,
 * etc. — pills that show today — and caused a "pills flash in then
 * vanish" once the layout GET settled.
 *
 * The grid renders a fixed mapped subset regardless of `tiles.visible`
 * (the long-tail slugs never appear in the grid), so defaulting EVERY
 * tile visible does NOT bloat the grid — it stays its curated, data-gated
 * set. What it restores is the tab strip's everything-with-data default:
