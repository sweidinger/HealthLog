 * Insights tile layout — persisted in `User.insightsLayoutJson`.

 * users. Null / missing column = default layout below; the GET endpoint
 * never lazy-writes a row, so the column only carries data once the
 * user has explicitly saved a layout.
 *
 * Mirrors `dashboard-layout.ts` for the dashboard widget surface — same
 * resolver / serializer semantics, same auto-merge of new tile IDs
 * introduced in later releases. Keeping the two modules structurally
 * identical means the iOS client + the Settings UI can share rendering
 * code paths against either surface.

/**
 * Every insights tile the layout knows about. The mother-page overview
 * is keyed `"overview"`; every other id is a routed sub-page slug under
 * `/insights/<slug>`. The order of entries here is irrelevant —
 * `DEFAULT_INSIGHTS_LAYOUT.tiles[].order` drives the visual order.
 * Exported so the API Zod `tileIdEnum` can be built from a single
 * source of truth.
 *
 * v1.8.7.1 — the tile-id universe is derived FROM `SUB_PAGE_SLUGS`
 * (`src/lib/insights/sub-page-metric.ts`), the same record the routed
 * tab strip and the per-metric sub-pages enumerate. The two surfaces
 * therefore stay in lockstep by construction: adding a sub-page slug
 * automatically widens the layout enum, and the iOS client can persist
 * a layout covering the full metric set (blood-pressure … skin-
 * temperature) rather than tripping a 422 on the ~25 slugs the layout
 * previously did not know about. `"overview"` is layout-only — it is
 * the mother page, not a sub-page slug — so it is prepended explicitly.
 *
 * v1.8.0 — the canonical ids are English, matching the routed slugs
 * (`/insights/<slug>`) and the naming-convention ADR
 * (`docs/adr/0001-insights-naming-convention.md`). The ids were German
 * through v1.7.x and the iOS layout-sync contract
 * (`GET/PUT /api/insights/layout`) speaks them, so the layout endpoint
 * keeps ACCEPTING the legacy German ids and NORMALISES them to the
 * canonical English ones on both read and write — see
 * `LEGACY_INSIGHTS_TILE_ID_ALIASES` + `normalizeInsightsTileId` below.
 * No client breaks; iOS migrates to the English ids at its own pace.
