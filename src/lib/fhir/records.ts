/**
 * v1.25 (W-RECORDS) — FHIR R4 emitters for the structured health records.
 *
 * Pure functions over the server-authoritative DTOs (`@/lib/records/dto`):
 *   - Allergy            → `AllergyIntolerance`
 *   - FamilyHistoryEntry → `FamilyMemberHistory`
 *
 * Vendor-blind + non-diagnostic, matching the illness `Condition` stance in
 * `./resources`: the user's own label rides `code.text` (NEVER a
 * machine-guessed SNOMED/RxNorm code); only the FHIR-defined value sets
 * (category, clinical/verification status, family-member RoleCode) carry
 * codings. Every resource is marked patient-reported (allergy
 * `verificationStatus: unconfirmed`; an explicit "not a clinical diagnosis"
 * note) so a clinician's viewer never reads it as an adjudicated finding.
 *
 * No FHIR SDK — narrow hand-rolled interfaces only (`./types`), matching the
 * project's "hand-rolled over the documented wire" convention. All text is
 * plain text; never user-supplied HTML.
