/**
 * v1.18.8 — HealthLog `IllnessType` → broad SNOMED CT category concept.
 *
 * The condition journal records PATIENT-REPORTED categories, not clinician
 * diagnoses. Each `IllnessType` therefore maps to a BROAD, well-known SNOMED
 * CT category concept (a disease class), NEVER a specific diagnosis. The
 * user's own free-text label rides `Condition.code.text` and the broad class
 * is also surfaced as `Condition.category.text`; this coded concept is the
 * honest middle ground — a downstream system reads "an infectious-disease
 * class condition the patient reported", not a fabricated specific diagnosis.
 *
 * The builder keeps `verificationStatus: unconfirmed` and the
 * "patient-reported, not a clinical diagnosis" note on every Condition, so the
 * category coding can never be mistaken for a confirmed finding.
 *
 * Concept ids are REFERENCED (not redistributed) per the SNOMED CT licence,
 * matching the existing route / body-site coding convention in `resources.ts`.
 * Each id below is a real SNOMED CT International concept; the category-level
 * choice is deliberate (a class, not a leaf disorder).
 *
 * Systems: SNOMED CT — http://snomed.info/sct
 *
 * No ICD-10 coding is emitted: a category-level ICD-10 chapter (e.g. "A00–B99
 * Certain infectious diseases") is a chapter RANGE, not a billable leaf code,
 * and asserting a single chapter code per journal category would over-state
 * what the patient recorded. SNOMED-only is the honest choice here.
