/**
 * v1.4.27 R3d MB4 — Coach launch context.
 *
 * Until v1.4.27 the Coach drawer was mounted inline on
 * `/insights/page.tsx` body, which meant navigating to a routed
 * sub-page (`/insights/blood-pressure`, etc.) unmounted the drawer and
 * removed every entry point to the Coach. The MA3 audit + Decision F
 * promoted the drawer up to `/insights/layout.tsx` so every routed
 * Insights surface can launch it.
 *
 * Shape:
 *   - `<CoachLaunchProvider>` owns the drawer's open / prefill state
 *     and renders the children beneath the launch surface.
 *   - `useCoachLaunch()` returns `{ open, askCoach, setOpen, prefill }`
 *     so any descendant can open the drawer with an optional prefill
 *     string (the hero-strip suggested-prompt chips feed prefills;
 *     the sticky `<CoachLaunchButton>` opens without one).
 *
 * The provider is intentionally tiny — the actual drawer mount sits
 * next to it in the layout, reading the same state via the hook.
