/**
 * v1.11.0 (Epic B, Pillar 3) — the `TRAJECTORY` forecasting derived metric.
 *
 * `computeTrajectory(userId, profile, opts)` projects a single metric's
 * recent trend a SHORT horizon forward with an HONEST, widening
 * prediction-interval band. It is the deterministic-compute extension of
 * the existing `trendSlope` (`src/lib/analytics/trends.ts:29`) which
 * already returns `slope` + `direction` + R² (as `confidence`):
 *
 *   - **fit** = ordinary least squares on the DAY-native per-day mean
 *     series (x = days since the window start, y = the per-day mean). The
 *     series is read exactly like the baseline engine
 *     (`readDayMeanSeries`) — rollup DAY buckets (`mean` composes) with a
 *     per-type bounded live-SQL fallback. NEVER from a composed WEEK/MONTH
 *     `sd`/`slope`: the rollup invariant forbids it (`baseline.ts:14-21`),
 *     so the fit + residual spread are computed at DAY granularity only.
 *   - **projection** = the fitted line evaluated at the next
 *     `horizonDays` day-offsets past the last observation.
 *   - **band** = the textbook OLS prediction interval
 *     `ŷ ± t·s·sqrt(1 + 1/n + (x−x̄)²/Sxx)`, which VISIBLY WIDENS the
 *     further the horizon strays from the data centre `x̄`. NOT a flat ±.
 *     The fanning band IS the uncertainty communication.
 *
 * Honesty gates (overclaiming a forecast is the top Epic-B risk). A
 * projection is produced ONLY when all hold; otherwise `insufficient`
 * (never a weak line, never extrapolated noise):
 *   - R² ≥ `TRAJECTORY_MIN_R2` (a weak-but-real trend, not noise).
 *   - `sampleDays ≥ TRAJECTORY_MIN_HISTORY_DAYS` (enough fit support).
 *   - the series is not stale: the window is anchored on `now` (like
 *     `trendSlope`) so a series with no recent points yields too few
 *     in-window days and gates out the same way the dashboard tile hides a
 *     stale average.
 *
 * The displayed confidence is server-computed from n + fit + recency
 * (`deriveCoverage`), never the model's self-confidence — the LLM never
 * invents the number; it only narrates a band that is already here.
 *
 * Server-only — reads the rollup tier + raw rows via the baseline reader.
 * The pure OLS + prediction-interval helpers are exported so the unit
 * test asserts the projection on a seeded trend and the band's widening.
