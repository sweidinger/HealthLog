/**
 * v1.10.0 — public barrel for the derived-metrics layer.
 *
 * The one module every consumer imports from. Append-only per wave —
 * Wave 1 exports the foundation (`Derived<T>` + coverage builders +
 * registry + norms + the flagship baseline engine + the route
 * dispatcher); W2/W3 append their per-metric engines (`fitness-age`,
 * `vascular-age`, `sleep-score`, `readiness`) here.
 *
 * Re-exports the client-safe types/coverage builders and the
 * server-only compute engines from one place; consumers import only what
 * they need. (A `"use client"` component must value-import only from
 * `./types` + `./coverage` + `./registry` — those are server-import-free.
 * The route + server consumers may import the engines below.)
