/**
 * v1.16.16 — canonical recovery resolution (one number, one engine).
 *
 * `RECOVERY_SCORE` is written by TWO sources that mean different things for the
 * same day:
 *   - `WHOOP`    — the device's own native recovery percentage (ground truth
 *                  when the user wears a WHOOP strap), ingested by the sync.
 *   - `COMPUTED` — the server-derived proxy (the READINESS blend persisted by
 *                  the nightly `recovery-score` job) — the fallback for a user
 *                  with no native recovery signal.
 *
 * The DECISION (locked): the WHOOP-native row is canonical WHEN PRESENT; the
 * COMPUTED proxy is the fallback. Every read surface — the wellness tile, the
 * doctor PDF, the iOS feed — must resolve to the SAME canonical row per day so
 * none of them shows the proxy and the native value as two competing series.
 *
 * Pure resolution: group rows by the physiological NIGHT they describe and,
 * per night, keep the WHOOP row when one exists, else the COMPUTED one. No DB
 * access here — the caller does the bounded read and passes rows in.
 *
 * THE DAY-ANCHOR PROBLEM (v1.16.16). The two sources stamp the SAME night on
 * opposite clocks:
 *   - WHOOP    stamps `measuredAt = updated_at` — the MORNING instant WHOOP
 *              finished scoring the night → the WAKE day D.
 *   - COMPUTED stamps `measuredAt = noon-UTC of scoreDayKey` where
 *              `scoreDayKey = (run morning) − 1 day` → the day-that-ENDED, D−1
 *              (`src/lib/insights/score-row.ts`). The 04:45 Europe/Berlin cron
 *              scores last night's signals but files them under the prior day.
 * So for ONE night the WHOOP row lands on day D and the COMPUTED proxy on day
 * D−1 — a systematic off-by-one. Bucketing raw `measuredAt` by calendar day
 * therefore leaves BOTH alive as two competing recovery days.
 *
 * The fix is a SOURCE-AWARE wake-day key: the COMPUTED proxy's day stamp is
 * shifted forward one day (the readiness of the day that ended IS the readiness
 * you wake with the next morning), and both keys are read in the user's LOCAL
 * timezone so a near-midnight / late re-score can't split a single night. The
 * COMPUTED proxy's own stored stamp (shared with stress / strain) is NOT
 * touched — the shift is a pure read-time alignment, so no ingest change and no
 * backfill are needed and two genuinely different nights stay separate.
