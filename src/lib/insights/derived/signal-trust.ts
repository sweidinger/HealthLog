/**
 * v1.22 (W9, C3) — which-signal-to-trust snapshot block.
 *
 * Reads the recent `RECOVERY_SCORE` rows (all sources) and, when two sources
 * materially diverge for the most recent night, surfaces the canonical pick +
 * the honest alternative so the Coach can NARRATE which it reads and why
 * ("I'm reading recovery from your band — the direct measure; the computed
 * estimate lags it by a few points"), instead of silently averaging or
 * flip-flopping. Below the materiality threshold the sources agree and the
 * block is omitted — the Coach never narrates trivial noise.
 *
 * Recovery is the only multi-source metric with a canonical resolver today
 * (`resolveCanonicalRecovery`); C3 is scoped to it for v1.22. Weight-from-two-
 * scales and HR-from-two-wearables are follow-ons once they grow a resolver.
 *
 * Server-only — reads Prisma. Fault-isolation is the caller's (the snapshot
 * wraps the call in `.catch`).
