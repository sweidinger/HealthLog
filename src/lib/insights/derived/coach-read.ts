/**
 * v1.22.0 (A1) — "Coach read" strip data builder.
 *
 * Two server-authoritative lines for a single metric sub-page, computed
 * here so web and iOS read the SAME resolved DTO (no client re-derivation):
 *
 *   1. own-baseline — the user's personal typical range (median ± k·MAD)
 *      from `computeVitalsBaseline`, plus where today's latest reading sits
 *      relative to it (within / above / below). Below the engine's 7-day
 *      history floor the band is `insufficient` and the strip says
 *      "still learning your range" — never a fabricated range.
 *   2. one lagged association — the single strongest discovered driver
 *      whose OUTCOME is this metric, surfaced from `readCoachCorrelations`
 *      (FDR-controlled, effect-size-floored, confidence-tiered). The line
 *      carries the engine's own never-causal interpretation verbatim. When
 *      nothing clears the existing floor the line is omitted entirely.
 *
 * Both inputs reuse the deterministic engines unchanged — no new statistics,
 * no lowered floor. Server-only (Prisma reads). The DTO shapes + the pure
 * selection helpers live in the client-safe `coach-read-shape.ts` sibling so
 * the strip component and the unit test can share them without pulling Prisma.
