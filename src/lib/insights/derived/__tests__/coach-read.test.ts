/**
 * v1.21.2 (A1) — "Coach read" strip selection logic.
 *
 * Covers the two decisions the strip turns on:
 *   1. band-line placement (within / above / below), incl. the inclusive
 *      edges that read "within", and the insufficient path (no band).
 *   2. driver-line pick + omission — strongest on-metric driver wins, and
 *      nothing on the metric ⇒ the line is omitted (null).
 *
 * Pure helpers — no Prisma, no engine round-trip. The MAD band itself + the
 * 7-day floor are owned by `baseline.test.ts`; this file pins only the strip's
 * own selection seam.
