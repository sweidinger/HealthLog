/**
 * v1.26.0 SEAM-N3 — the adherence storyline must read the SAME
 * schedule-anchored, cadence-aware adherence number the dashboard tile does.
 *
 * The regression this pins: the storyline used to derive its adherence % from
 * `readMedicationCompliance`, the RAW coverage rollup whose `scheduled` counts
 * LOGGED intake slots. A user who logs only the doses they TOOK — never
 * minting `takenAt:null` reminder rows for the doses they missed — therefore
 * read ~100 % adherence (every logged row was both numerator and denominator),
 * and the dip gate (`adherencePct > 80 → null`) wrongly suppressed the whole
 * storyline. Anchoring on the recurrence engine's EXPECTED-dose count makes the
 * missed days pull the rate below 100 %.
 *
 * The real compliance engine (`@/lib/analytics/compliance`) and the shared
 * `buildScheduleAnchoredComplianceBuckets` run unmocked here — only the DB and
 * the vital-series reader are stubbed — so the test exercises the actual
 * expected-dose expansion, not a re-mock of it.
