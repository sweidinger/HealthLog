/**
 * v1.22.0 (A1) — "Coach read" strip: shared shapes + pure selection logic.

 * and the strip renders, plus the two pure decisions the strip turns on —
 * band placement (within / above / below) and the on-metric driver pick. The
 * server builder (`coach-read.ts`) composes these over the baseline +
 * correlation engines; the unit test pins them directly.
