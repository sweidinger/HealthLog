/**
 * v1.17.0 — MCTQ chronotype + social jetlag (server-authoritative).
 *
 * Implements the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire derivation from observed
 * sleep, not a survey: Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice & Merrow (2003), *J Biol
 * Rhythms* 18(1):80-90; Roenneberg et al. (2007), *Sleep Med Rev* 11(6):429-
 * 438. The chronotype marker is MID-SLEEP ON FREE DAYS (MSF) — the clock time
 * halfway between sleep onset and wake on days without an alarm — corrected
 * for the sleep debt people pay off by sleeping in on free days (MSFsc).
 *
 *   MSF      = circular mean of free-day sleep midpoints (minutes-of-day).
 *   MSFsc    = MSF − 0.5·(SDf − SDweek)   when SDf > SDweek, else MSF
 *              where SDf  = average free-day sleep DURATION,
 *                    SDweek = average sleep duration across work + free days.
 *   SJL      = social jetlag = circular |MSF_work − MSF_free|.
 *
 * The MSFsc correction (Roenneberg 2007) removes the morning "oversleep" that
 * a sleep-debt rebound adds to the free-day midpoint, so a workweek-deprived
 * sleeper is not mislabelled later than their true phase.
 *
 * ONE MIDPOINT ESTIMATOR
 * ----------------------
 * The per-night `midpointMinutes` is the SAME minutes-of-day midpoint the
 * Sleep Score's Timing sub-score reads (centre of the canonical asleep span,
 * in the user's wall clock). The caller supplies it; chronotype does NOT
 * re-derive a second midpoint — and it reuses `circularMeanMinutes` /
 * `circularMinuteDistance` from the Sleep Score so the midnight-straddle / DST
 * handling is identical. Pure — no Prisma, no I/O; route, Coach, PDF, and the
 * iOS serializer all reuse it.
 *
 * LEARNING GATE
 * -------------
 * Chronotype is a stable trait and a thin sample is noise. Below
 * `minFreeNights` free-day nights the result is a calm "still learning — N of
 * M nights" state and asserts NO type. This mirrors the Sleep Score's
 * "< 3 nights → null" timing gate; the band only appears once the free-day
 * sample is large enough to mean something.
 *
 * FREE vs WORK
 * ------------
 * The app has no work calendar, so the day-type signal is an INPUT per night
 * (the caller maps weekday/weekend or a future shift schedule). A modelling
 * assumption, surfaced as such — not hardcoded here.
