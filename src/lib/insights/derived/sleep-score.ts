/**
 * v1.10.0 — transparent Sleep Score (catalogue metric #6, COMPOSITE).
 *
 * A 0–100 sleep-quality composite whose sub-scores are SHOWN, not a black
 * box. Built from the per-stage `SLEEP_DURATION` rows HealthKit + Withings
 * write (one row per stage per night, `value` in minutes, `sleepStage` ∈
 * { IN_BED, AWAKE, ASLEEP, REM, CORE, DEEP }). Combines:
 *
 *   - **Sufficiency** = total asleep minutes vs an age-based need target
 *     (Hirshkowitz et al. 2015 National Sleep Foundation recommendations).
 *   - **Efficiency**  = asleep ÷ in-bed minutes (AASM scoring convention;
 *     ≥ 85 % is the clinical "good" floor).
 *   - **Consistency** = SD of the sleep midpoint across the window (lower
 *     is better) — a regularity proxy.
 *   - **Composition** = REM% + Deep% of total asleep vs Ohayon et al. 2017
 *     age norms.
 *
 * Each sub-score is 0..100 with its own transparent weight; the composite
 * **reweights around missing sub-scores** exactly as `health-score.ts`
 * null-redistributes (a legacy `ASLEEP`-only night yields Sufficiency +
 * Efficiency + Consistency + Timing, dropping Composition gracefully — it
 * is never fabricated). Restfulness / Restoration are NOT derivable (no
 * per-stage HR, no WASO timestamps) and are omitted, not faked.
 *
 * Standard: AASM scoring conventions (efficiency); Hirshkowitz et al. 2015,
 * Sleep Health 1(1):40–43 (age-based duration need); Ohayon et al. 2017,
 * Sleep Health 3(1):6–19 (stage-percentage norms by age). Framing
 * discipline: consumer sleep-staging vs PSG is only moderately accurate —
 * the copy stays directional, never clinical.
 *
 * Server-only — reads raw `SLEEP_DURATION` rows via Prisma (per-stage rows
 * are not rolled up by stage, so the night reconstruction reads raw, but
 * bounded to the window). The pure scorers are exported for unit tests.
