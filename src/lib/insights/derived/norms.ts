/**
 * v1.10.0 — age/sex reference-range tables (the F1 enabler).
 *
 * The generic assessment registry (`metric-status-registry.ts`) already
 * threads a coarse, demographic-flat `normalRange` per metric and already
 * passes `age` + `sex` into the prompt. This module SHARPENS that slot:
 * `lookupNormalRange(metricId, ageYears, sex)` returns an age/sex-adjusted
 * band when a cited standard supports one, falling back to `null` so the
 * caller keeps the existing flat anchor (additive, behind the existing
 * behaviour — never a regression).
 *
 * Strictly age + sex. NO ancestry / ethnicity / region-of-birth ranges —
 * that is medically contentious and a data category HealthLog does not
 * collect (the registry already states this stance).
 *
 * Cited standards (one per table):
 *   - VO₂max percentile norms — Cooper Institute / FRIEND registry:
 *     Kaminsky et al. 2015, "Reference Standards for Cardiorespiratory
 *     Fitness Measured With Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing", Mayo Clinic
 *     Proceedings 90(11):1515–1523. (The 50th-percentile age×sex band.)
 *   - Resting heart rate by age — standard physiology / population
 *     reference (adult resting-HR narrows with the AHA 60–100 bpm anchor;
 *     children/adolescents run higher — Fleming et al. 2011, Lancet
 *     377(9770):1011–1018, normal-range HR centiles by age).
 *   - Respiratory rate by age — clinical reference (WHO/PALS adult vs
 *     paediatric ranges).
 *   - Six-minute-walk distance — a published REGRESSION (not a bracket
 *     table): Enright & Sherrill 1998, "Reference Equations for the
 *     Six-Minute Walk in Healthy Adults", Am J Respir Crit Care Med
 *     158(5):1384–1387; the test itself standardised by ATS 2002,
 *     "ATS Statement: Guidelines for the Six-Minute Walk Test",
 *     Am J Respir Crit Care Med 166(1):111–117. Surfaced as a
 *     percent-of-predicted re-frame, never a HealthLog-derived equation.
 *   - Grip strength by age × sex — Dodds et al. 2014, "Grip Strength
 *     across the Life Course: Normative Data from Twelve British Studies",
 *     PLOS ONE 9(12):e113637 (n≈49,964). The age×sex band low is the 10th
 *     centile, FLOORED at the EWGSOP2 "probable sarcopenia" cut-off
 *     (Cruz-Jentoft et al., Age Ageing 2019: men < 27 kg, women < 16 kg) so
 *     the clinical floor is never crossed; the band high is the 50th-centile
 *     (median) for the age×sex cell.
 *   - Waist circumference by age × sex — WHO increased-risk thresholds
 *     (WHO 2008/2011; men > 94 cm, women > 80 cm) as the adult floor, raised
 *     for older adults: the WHO cut-points derive from cohorts aged 20–74,
 *     and evidence in the elderly supports cut-points set at higher waist
 *     values (toward the WHO substantially-increased-risk line, men > 102 cm /
 *     women > 88 cm). No ethnicity adjustment — HealthLog does not collect
 *     ancestry.
 *
 * Client-safe — pure data + a pure lookup, no server imports.
