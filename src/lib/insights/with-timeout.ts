 * Race an awaited promise against a hard timeout.
 *
 * The seven `*-status.ts` routes await `provider.generateCompletion()`
 * and need an upper bound so a stalled provider does not pin the
 * InsightStatusCard behind React-Query's retries. `withTimeout` resolves
 * with the wrapped promise's value when it lands inside the budget, or
 * the `fallback` value otherwise.
 *
 * Returns a typed envelope so the call site can distinguish a real
 * timeout from an upstream error from a normal value, and react
 * differently to each — a timeout/error must NOT be persisted as a
 * day-long cache entry the way a real assessment is.
 *
 * The budget matches the provider clients' own 60 s ceiling. The
 * earlier 20 s cap fired below the providers' floor on cold starts and
 * model warm-ups, converting healthy-but-slow generations into the
 * generic fallback; aligning the two lets a slow-but-valid round-trip
 * land instead of being discarded.
