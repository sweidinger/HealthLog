/**
 * v1.18.7 (HIGH-1) — the shared "prepare → run → finalize" contract for the
 * seven specialised per-metric status cards.
 *
 * Before this, every `*-status.ts` generator was a single monolithic
 * function: cache-read → read-only miss → snapshot build → content-hash
 * gate → ONE `runStatusCompletion` → persist. A fully instrumented account
 * fired seven of those LLM round-trips per warm cycle, each re-analysing the
 * same measurement rows the comprehensive briefing already covered.
 *
 * The fix splits each generator at the LLM boundary:
 *
 *   prepare<Metric>StatusForUser(...)  → PreparedStatusCard
 *     runs everything up to (but not including) the provider call. Either it
 *     resolves to a finished `served` result (a cache hit, a read-only miss,
 *     an unchanged-data refresh, or no provider / no consent — every shape
 *     that never needed the LLM), or it returns a `pending` descriptor: the
 *     built prompts + snapshot hash + a `finalize(summary)` closure that
 *     persists exactly the cache row the old code wrote.
 *
 *   generate<Metric>StatusForUser(...)  (the unchanged public entry)
 *     calls prepare, and on `pending` runs ONE `runStatusCompletion` and
 *     finalizes — i.e. the single-card path is byte-for-byte the old
 *     behaviour, so a lone card visit still costs exactly one call and the
 *     graceful fallback is preserved.
 *
 *   generateStatusBatchForUser(...)  (status-batch.ts)
 *     calls all seven prepares, collects the `pending` ones, sends ONE
 *     prompt for `{ perMetric: { ... } }`, and fans each returned summary
 *     into that metric's `finalize` — so the warm passes pay one call for
 *     the whole set. A metric the batch omits or that the batch call fails
 *     for falls back to its own single-card path, never crashing the cycle.
 *
 * The cache + read contract is untouched: `finalize` persists the SAME
 * `auditLog` row (`persistStatusInsight`, or the richer medication-compliance
 * shape via a custom closure) the standalone generator wrote, so every card
 * keeps reading per-metric results with the same keys.
