/**
 * v1.25 — breathing-disturbance screening shaping.
 *
 * Reads the per-night sleep-breathing-disturbance index
 * (`BREATHING_DISTURBANCES`, lower-better) and the device-flagged
 * breathing-disturbance / possible-apnea events (`BREATHING_DISTURBANCE_EVENT`)
 * a sync writes, and folds them into a calm awareness summary: how many nights
 * are covered, the recent mean index, the short-window trend, and the device's
 * own classification.
 *
 * This is a SCREENING SIGNAL ONLY — never a HealthLog diagnosis. The card built
 * on top of this states that explicitly. The classification mirrors the device:
 * a night the device flagged with one or more elevated-breathing events reads
 * as "elevated"; with index nights and no flagged event it reads as
 * "not-elevated". HealthLog invents no numeric threshold of its own.
 *
 * The math lives here, free of Prisma, so the present / absent / trend states
 * are unit-testable in isolation.
