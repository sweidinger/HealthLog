/**
 * v1.4.36 W3 T3 — exclude-metrics filter for the AI Insights payload.
 *
 * Mirrors the Coach snapshot's `excludeMetrics` contract so the user
 * has a single privacy contract across both surfaces: what's hidden
 * from the Coach turn stays hidden from the Insights generation. The
 * filter drops matching keys off the features object BEFORE
 * `JSON.stringify` so the LLM never sees the excluded data.
 *
 * The token vocabulary is the same `coachExcludeMetricEnum` from
 * `src/lib/validations/coach-prefs.ts` — see the comment there for
 * the canonical list. The mapping below pairs each token with the
 * features.ts field keys it gates; tokens with no mapped fields
 * (e.g. Apple Health metrics that don't have a dedicated features
 * branch yet) are no-ops on this surface but keep the contract
 * symmetric so adding a future field is one-line.
 *
 * Anthropometrics is special-cased: rather than dropping the whole
 * `context` field (which carries non-PII totals like `dataSpanDays`),
 * we strip just `heightCm` / `ageYears` / `gender` from it.
