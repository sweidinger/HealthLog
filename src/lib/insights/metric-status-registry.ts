/**
 * v1.8.7.1 — generic per-metric assessment registry.
 *
 * The seven specialised assessment scopes (blood-pressure / pulse /
 * weight / bmi / mood / medication-compliance / general) each ship a
 * bespoke generator + prompt. The ~30 HealthKit metric pages
 * (`HealthKitMetricPage`) carried charts but no plain-language
 * assessment, because hand-writing 30 more prompts is not viable.
 *
 * This registry is the data-driven alternative: each HealthKit metric is
 * described by the small amount of metadata a generic generator needs to
 * assess it — a display name, a unit, the direction a "good" value moves,
 * an optional clinical/consumer normal range, and an archetype that
 * selects one of six shared prompt templates. A metric with no entry here
 * simply gets no assessment card (the safe default the spec calls for).
 *
 * Metric ids are the existing `InsightMetric` HealthKit identifiers
 * (WEIGHT, RESTING_HEART_RATE, SLEEP_DURATION, …) so the UI contract,
 * the route query param, and the cache scope all speak one vocabulary.
 * Internally each id maps to the `MeasurementType` the rollup tier and
 * the raw `Measurement` rows are keyed by (a handful differ — `STEPS`
 * is stored as `ACTIVITY_STEPS`, `ACTIVE_ENERGY` as `ACTIVE_ENERGY_BURNED`).
 *
 * The seven specialised metrics (WEIGHT, BLOOD_PRESSURE_*, PULSE, BMI,
 * MOOD, MEDICATION) are intentionally NOT registered here — they keep
 * their existing dedicated scopes and are never routed through the
 * generic path.
 *
 * Medical note (design §"Medical note"): normal ranges are population
 * anchors a generic consumer/clinical guideline supports, used only as a
 * coarse placement aid. The generator's primary signal is the user's OWN
 * baseline (the graded series), and where the profile stores age + sex
 * (`dateOfBirth` + `gender`) the generator threads them so the model can
 * sanity-check the placement. NO ancestry/region-of-birth ranges — that
 * is medically contentious and a data category HealthLog does not
 * collect.
