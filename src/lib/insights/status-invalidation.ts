 * Minimum gap between a scope's last cached (re)generation and the next

 * (re)generated within this window is left intact on a fresh measurement
 * ingest — not re-enqueued.
 *
 * A constantly-syncing client (Apple Health drips batches every few
 * minutes) used to delete + re-enqueue every dirtied scope on every batch,
 * and because each delete dropped the cache row the per-(user,scope,locale)
 * enqueue singleton (120 s) could not coalesce across batches that arrive
 * minutes apart — so STEPS / general / a metric card regenerated several
 * times an hour and the assessment felt "regenerated on every visit". This
 * window coalesces the storm: a genuinely stale scope (no fresh assessment)
 * still refreshes immediately, but a scope refreshed inside the window is
 * skipped, so a fresh assessment survives the day's sync drip.
 *
 * v1.16.8 — first widened from 30 min to 6 h to bound provider spend, but
 * a 6 h wall meant same-day data was not narrated same-day: the nightly
 * warm at 04:30 restarted the window, so a notable 08:00 reading never
 * re-enqueued its scopes and the card showed the pre-reading text until
 * the next nightly tick. The window is now a ONE-HOUR minimum gap, and
 * the budget role the 6 h wall carried moves to the worker's content-hash
 * gate: every ingest that lands past the gap re-enqueues the dirtied
 * scopes, the worker's forced run re-gathers the snapshot, and the gate
 * (`refreshUnchangedStatusInsight`) turns an unchanged snapshot into a
 * timestamp refresh with zero provider cost. So this clock only bounds
 * the SQL-gather frequency — at most one worker run per scope per hour
 * under a constant sync drip — while provider spend tracks actual data
 * change, which is what the gate exists to meter. Comparing the hash
 * inline at invalidation time was rejected: it would run the full
 * per-scope data gather inside the ingest path, which is exactly the
 * work the queue exists to keep off that path.
