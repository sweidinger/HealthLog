/**
 * v1.4.27 F17/F18/F19 — single decision point for "does the user have
 * any observations on this metric?".
 *
 * Three render gates consume this helper:
 *
 *   1. The routed Insights sub-pages (`/insights/{slug}/page.tsx`)
 *      early-return an empty-state with a CTA when the gate is false.
 *   2. The Insights tab strip (`<InsightsTabStrip>`) filters pills so
 *      a metric with zero observations doesn't surface a navigation
 *      target the user can't act on.
 *   3. The dashboard tile registry (`src/app/page.tsx`) — wired in
 *      bucket B1 — applies the same gate per tile.
 *
 * Source signals:
 *
 *   - Sensor metrics (`PULSE`, `WEIGHT`, `BMI`, `BLOOD_PRESSURE_*`,
 *     `SLEEP_DURATION`, `VO2_MAX`, `STEPS`, `ACTIVE_ENERGY`) read
 *     `summaries[METRIC].count` from the analytics endpoint.
 *   - `BMI` is derived from `WEIGHT` so it inherits the weight count.
 *   - Event-driven metrics (`MOOD`, `MEDICATION`) read the boolean
 *     `hasMood` / `hasMedication` flags the caller threads in from
 *     `/api/insights/comprehensive` (mood summary count > 0,
 *     medications array length > 0).
 *
 * Auto-light-up behaviour: once the iOS native client uploads its
 * first Apple-Health measurement, `summaries[METRIC].count` flips
 * from 0 to ≥1 and the next React-Query refetch reveals the matching
 * pill, sub-page, and dashboard tile — no separate feature flag
 * needed. (F18.)

/**
 * Metric keys the gating helper distinguishes. Mirrors the

 * Adding a new metric is a one-place change: list it here, decide
 * which branch of `hasMetricData` handles it, and the sub-page /
 * tab strip / dashboard tile gates pick it up automatically.
