/**
 * v1.7.0 W6 — shared comprehensive-insight generator.
 *
 * The on-demand `POST /api/insights/generate` route and the nightly
 * `insight-pregenerate` cron both need to run the same pipeline:
 * resolve the provider chain → extract + compact features → build the
 * strict prompt → run the completion with fallback → parse + cache the
 * result. This module is that single source of truth so the briefing
 * the cron pre-generates is byte-identical to what an on-demand
 * regenerate would have produced.
 *
 * The route keeps its request-specific concerns (rate-limit gate,
 * locale resolution from the request, audit-with-IP). The cron supplies
 * its own budget gate (a per-user rate-limit bucket so a nightly
 * fan-out across every user can never blow the LLM budget) before
 * calling `generateComprehensiveInsight`.
 *
 * NO synchronous request lifecycle: the cron path runs entirely on
 * pg-boss, never inside an HTTP handler.
