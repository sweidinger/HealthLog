 * `snapshotHash` equals the fresh snapshot's hash, nothing the prompt

 * skips the LLM call entirely. Returns `null` on any miss (no prior

 * those means the caller should generate for real.
 *
 * This single gate is what turns the nightly warm, the forced warm, and
 * the ingest-driven regeneration into no-ops on unchanged data: each of
 * those paths forces past the same-day cache read, gathers the
 * snapshot, and lands here.
 *
 * Consent comes BEFORE the hash compare (mirroring the comprehensive
 * pipeline's consent-before-gate order): re-stamping a cached text
 * under today's `dateKey` presents it as a current AI assessment, so a
 * user who revoked the server-managed AI consent must not have old
 * text re-dated by an unchanged-data refresh. On a blocked consent the
 * gate misses, the generator proceeds to `runStatusCompletion`, and
 * that gate returns the no-key fallback without persisting anything.
