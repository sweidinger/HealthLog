/**
 * Dated failure marker for the daily-briefing generation.
 *
 * The briefing keeps its last good payload on a failed refresh: the generator
 * writes NO `User.insightsCachedText` row when a provider times out or errors,
 * so the previous briefing stays intact and the surface never blanks. What was
 * missing is a signal the READ path can use to tell the difference between "no
 * refresh was due" and "the last refresh attempt failed" — without that, a
 * stale-but-shown briefing reads as current and a never-generated one shows a
 * generic empty state instead of an honest "couldn't generate".
 *
 * This records an append-only `auditLog` row (no migration, no overwrite of the
 * cached text) carrying the calendar day, the reason, and the locale. The read
 * path compares the latest marker's timestamp against the last successful
 * generation (`User.insightsCachedAt`): a marker newer than the last success
 * means the most recent attempt failed.

 *                     timeout for a slow local model.
 *   - `auth`        — the provider rejected the request (4xx that is not 429).
 *                     Lever: re-check the provider / API key in Settings.
 *   - `rate-limit`  — the provider returned 429.
 *   - `provider`    — a 5xx / generic upstream failure.
