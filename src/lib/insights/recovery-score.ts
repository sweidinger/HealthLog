/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-C). The Recovery score ENGINE + persistence.
 *
 * This is the PERSISTING counterpart to the compute-on-read `READINESS`
 * derived engine (`src/lib/insights/derived/readiness.ts`). The derived
 * engine answers a live request with a `Derived<T>`; this module reuses that
 * exact math and writes the result as a queryable / chartable /
 * iOS-readable `Measurement` row so the score has the same first-class
 * storage shape as a vital — a daily 0–100 series the dashboard, charts, and
 * the native client can read without recomputing.
 *
 * The row is:
 *   - `type   = RECOVERY_SCORE`
 *   - `source = COMPUTED`        (server-owned; a client can never POST it)
 *   - `unit   = "score"`         (the canonical unit; see `validations/measurement`)
 *   - `value  = 0..100`          (plausibility-pinned to {min:0, max:100})
 *   - `externalId = recovery:YYYY-MM-DD` (the per-day idempotency key)
 *
 * Idempotent per user per day: a re-run upserts on
 * `(userId, type, source, externalId)` rather than minting a duplicate, so
 * the nightly job is safe to re-fire and a same-day re-compute (e.g. after a
 * late watch sync) overwrites the day's score in place.
 *
 * Honest confidence: the score is only stored when the underlying readiness
 * blend reaches its minimum-component floor (`READINESS_MIN_COMPONENTS`).
 * Below that the engine returns `insufficient` and NO row is written — the
 * series never carries a headline derived from 1-of-N signals.
 *
 * Standard / framing: RHR elevation + HRV (SDNN) suppression as recovery
 * markers — Plews et al. 2013, Sports Medicine 43(9):773–781; Buchheit 2014,
 * Frontiers in Physiology 5:73 (same lineage as the READINESS derived
 * engine). The score is descriptive — a daily wellness proxy, NOT a clinical
 * or training-recovery assessment, and it is excluded from the doctor PDF.
 *
 * Server-only — never call this on a page visit. It runs from the nightly
 * pg-boss job in `src/lib/jobs/recovery-score.ts`.
