/**
 * v1.21.2 (A6) — per-metric in/out-of-band streak + return-to-baseline event.
 *
 * A PURE detector over a DAY-bucket per-day-mean series. It answers two
 * questions the "ambient Coach presence" surface needs to close a worry:
 *
 *   1. How many consecutive days has this metric sat INSIDE (or OUTSIDE) its
 *      personal range, counting back from the most recent day? A streak is
 *      strictly consecutive: a calendar GAP day (a day with no reading)
 *      BREAKS it — we never paper over a missing day as "still inside".
 *   2. Did the metric just RETURN to its personal range after a run outside
 *      it? "Back inside your usual range after last week's dip — whatever that
 *      was, it's passed." A return only fires when a prior OUT-of-band run of
 *      at least `MIN_OUT_RUN` days is followed by an IN-band run of at least
 *      `MIN_IN_RUN` days ending on the latest day. Without a genuine prior
 *      out-of-band run there is nothing to "return" from.
 *
 * The band is the user's OWN personal range: median ± k·MAD (Hampel/Leys),
 * built by `buildBaselineBand` from the SAME series — never an invented
 * clinical threshold. The band is established over the WHOLE series so a
 * single recent dip doesn't move the goalposts; callers that want a stricter
 * "prior period establishes the band" split can pass a pre-built band.
 *
 * Inherent-low conservatism: when the series is too short to establish a band
 * (or the caller passes none and `buildBaselineBand` returns null), the
 * detector returns a quiet `null`-streak result and fires NO return event —
 * it omits rather than guesses.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no clock, no network. Fully unit-testable over injected series.
