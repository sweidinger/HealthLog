/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-E). The Stress score ENGINE + persistence.
 *
 * HONEST FRAMING (load-bearing — read before changing the label or copy):
 * Apple Watch has NO electrodermal-activity (EDA / galvanic) sensor. There
 * is no continuous stress measurement in HealthKit. What HealthKit DOES
 * give is discrete heart-rate-variability (SDNN) samples through the day.
 * This engine derives a defensible *proxy* from the intra-day SDNN signal —
 * autonomic-balance research treats a SUPPRESSED, less-variable HRV through
 * the day as a marker of higher sympathetic ("stress") load. It is NOT a
 * direct stress measurement and the provenance/label must always say
 * "HRV-derived proxy", never imply a galvanic / EDA reading.
 *
 * The proxy (0–100, higher = more inferred stress):
 *   - Read the day's intra-day `HEART_RATE_VARIABILITY` (SDNN, ms) samples
 *     (the dense intra-day retention tier keeps these raw within its
 *     window — see `dense-intraday-retention.ts`).
 *   - Take the day's MEAN SDNN.
 *   - Compare it to the user's personal SDNN baseline (the robust
 *     median/MAD band from the shared vitals-baseline engine over a 7-day
 *     reference window). HRV is "higher-better" for recovery; a day mean
 *     BELOW baseline = HRV suppression = higher inferred stress.
 *   - Map the suppression deviation to 0–100 via the same MAD-scaled
 *     deviation scorer the readiness blend uses (one spread below baseline
 *     → ~50, two spreads → ~100), then INVERT so suppression raises stress.
 *
 * Honest confidence: the score is only stored when the day has at least
 * `STRESS_MIN_INTRADAY_SAMPLES` SDNN samples AND the SDNN baseline is
 * usable. Below that the engine returns `insufficient` and NO row is
 * written — the series never carries a headline from a single spot reading
 * or an unestablished baseline.
 *
 * Standard / framing: HRV (SDNN) suppression + reduced variability as a
 * sympathetic-load marker — Kim et al. 2018, "Stress and Heart Rate
 * Variability: A Meta-Analysis", Psychiatry Investigation 15(3):235–245;
 * Thayer et al. 2012, Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews 36(2):747–756.
 * The score is descriptive — a daily wellness proxy, NOT a clinical
 * assessment, and it is excluded from the doctor PDF.
 *
 * Row shape (identical posture to the Recovery score):
 *   - `type   = STRESS_SCORE`
 *   - `source = COMPUTED`        (server-owned; a client can never POST it)
 *   - `unit   = "score"`
 *   - `value  = 0..100`          (plausibility-pinned to {min:0, max:100})
 *   - `externalId = stress:YYYY-MM-DD` (the per-day idempotency key)
 *
 * Server-only — runs from the nightly pg-boss job in
 * `src/lib/jobs/stress-score.ts`.
