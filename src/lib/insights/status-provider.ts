/**
 * Shared provider plumbing for the seven `*-status.ts` generators.
 *
 * Before this, each generator resolved a single provider via
 * `resolveProvider()` and raced one `generateCompletion()` call against
 * a 20 s cap. A degraded primary provider could not cascade, and the
 * cap fired below the providers' own 60 s floor — converting healthy-
 * but-slow generations into the generic fallback.
 *
 * This helper mirrors the Coach (`chat/route.ts`): resolve the user's
 * provider chain, fall back to the legacy single provider when the chain
 * is empty, and run `runRawCompletionWithFallback` so a degraded provider
 * cascades to the next. The whole thing is still wrapped in
 * `withTimeout` at the aligned 60 s budget so a total stall can't pin the
 * card — but a timeout / error is reported as a transient miss (the
 * caller serves the fallback for this render without persisting it),
 * never as the day's cached assessment.
