/**
 * v1.10.0 — FDR-controlled correlation discovery engine.
 *
 * Promotes the legacy three-fixed-hypothesis `correlations.ts` to a bounded
 * ALL-PAIRS discovery over a curated behaviour × outcome matrix, lagged
 * (a behaviour on day D vs an outcome on day D+1), Benjamini-Hochberg
 * FDR-controlled on top of the existing exact Student-t / n ≥ 20 / p < 0.05
 * gates. Only statistically-defensible pairs surface, each with an honest
 * "descriptive, not causal" caveat.
 *
 * Why FDR: scanning many pairs inflates the family-wise false-discovery
 * rate — at p < 0.05 alone, 1-in-20 noise pairs surface as "significant".
 * Benjamini & Hochberg (1995), J. R. Stat. Soc. B 57(1):289–300 controls
 * the expected proportion of false discoveries among the surfaced pairs to
 * `FDR_Q` (default 0.10). A pair surfaces only when its rank-adjusted q
 * clears the threshold — so the card count stays honest as the matrix grows.
 *
 * Lagging: a behaviour (today's daylight, mood, glucose, BP) is paired with
 * the NEXT day's outcome (sleep, HRV, resting HR, weight). The lag encodes
 * the plausible direction ("more daylight today → better sleep tonight")
 * without claiming causation — the caveat is displayed verbatim.
 *
 * Pearson + the exact incomplete-beta p-value are reused from
 * `src/lib/insights/correlations.ts` (its docstring explicitly anticipates
 * this auto-discovery widening the pair grid). This module is PURE over
 * already-fetched daily series — the DB read lives in the route.
 *
 * Framing discipline: descriptive, never causal; every pair carries n, r,
 * p, and the BH-adjusted q.
 *
 * v1.21.0 (FDREXTEND) — medication compliance (a daily adherence rate from the
 * compliance engine's dose-history ledger) and symptom severity (the illness
 * day-log functional-impact / symptom-burden track) are now first-class daily
 * channels in the matrix, so the high-value "adherence dip → symptom flare" and
 * "compliance↓ → a vital drifting" links can finally be discovered. They are
 * the sparsest, noisiest inputs in the system — they flow through the SAME
 * n ≥ 20 / p < 0.05 / BH-FDR / effect-size-floor / shrinkage gates as every
 * other channel, so a thin series degrades to absent rather than to a spurious
 * link. The series builders live in `correlation-series-builders.ts`.

 * unreachable for a biomarker — folding `LAB:*` into `DISCOVERY_*` would only

 * CONTEMPORANEOUS windowed mean of an outcome the marker plausibly reflects
 * (HbA1c ↔ the period's mean glucose; lipids ↔ weight). That is a point-vs-window
 * statistic over the DRAWS (n = number of draws), not a daily lag — so it gets
