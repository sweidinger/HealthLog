/**
 * v1.10.0 — computed scores (WX-C/E). Shared score-row helpers.
 *
 * The three nightly score engines (Recovery / Stress / Strain) all file one
 * `COMPUTED` Measurement row per user per scored day, keyed by the same
 * day-stamp triplet (a `prefix:YYYY-MM-DD` externalId, a noon-UTC
 * `measuredAt`, the UTC day key) and written through the same idempotent
 * `(userId, type, source, externalId)` upsert. Before this module each engine
 * carried a byte-identical copy of that triplet + upsert, differing only by
 * the `prefix` / `type` literal.
 *
 * SCORED DAY = THE PREVIOUS UTC DAY. The crons fire ~03:xx UTC (04:45–04:55
 * Europe/Berlin). At that moment the CURRENT UTC day is only a few hours old:
 * the Strain engine would miss the just-completed day's workouts and the
 * Stress engine would see a near-empty intra-day SDNN set and gate as
 * `insufficient`. Every engine therefore scores the day that just ENDED —
 * `now − 1 day` — resolved once, here, so the externalId / measuredAt / day
 * key can never drift between the three.
 *
 * `scoreDayKey` / `scoreMeasuredAt` / `scoreExternalId` are pure (no Prisma)
 * so the engines' day-stamp tests can drive them directly; `upsertScoreRow`
 * takes the (worker) client.
