/**
 * v1.4.25 W4 — slug → metric mapping for the routed insights sub-pages.
 *
 * The mother page (`/insights`) hosts the overview (hero + briefing +
 * trends + advisor). Each named slug below is a sub-route that focuses
 * one metric. Charts on the sub-pages still use the dashboard chart-cog
 * surface — see `chartKey` strings in `src/lib/dashboard-layout.ts`
 * (`CHART_OVERLAY_KEYS`).
 *
 * v1.8.0 — the slugs are English. They were German through v1.7.x; the
 * naming-convention ADR (`docs/adr/0001-insights-naming-convention.md`)
 * settled the surface: UI copy stays localised (resolved through `t()`
 * keys), but internal identifiers — route slugs, tile ids, query keys —
 * are English. Legacy `/insights/<de-slug>` URLs 301-redirect to their
 * English target via `next.config.ts` `redirects()`.
 *
 * `medications` carries no `MeasurementType[]` because medication
 * compliance is event-driven (`MedicationIntakeEvent` rows) rather than
 * time-series `Measurement` rows; the page fetches that data via the
 * existing `/api/insights/comprehensive` consumer.
 *
 * `bmi` lists `WEIGHT` because BMI is derived client-side —
 * `WEIGHT / (heightCm/100)^2` — and the chart sets `valueMode="bmi"` on
 * `<HealthChart>`. The user's height lives on the profile, so there is
 * no separate height series to fetch.
