/**
 * v1.28.x — the metric catalog data model.
 *
 * Backs `/insights/catalog`: a single, on-purpose surface answering "what
 * can HealthLog track, and what feeds it" for the ~90 metric types the
 * primary Insights nav deliberately hides while they carry zero data (see
 * `metric-availability.ts` docblock — "a metric with zero observations
 * doesn't surface a navigation target the user can't act on"). That floor
 * is correct for the daily nav; it also means an account with a sparse
 * device kit has NO reachable surface that says a capability exists at
 * all (2026-07-17 discoverability audit, "the availability floor" finding).
 * This module is the one place that lists every capability regardless of
 * whether the account has data for it yet.
 *
 * Every entry's name + source copy is SOURCED from the existing, already-
 * localised per-metric empty-state strings — never hand-duplicated here.
 * `insights.<slug>.emptyState.description` (the `HealthKitMetricPage`
 * pattern) or `insights.emptyState.<key>.description` (the seven
 * specialised metrics) already say honestly, per metric, what supplies it
 * ("HRV samples land here once Apple Watch — or a compatible Withings
 * device — starts syncing nightly readings."). Reusing them means the
 * catalog cannot drift from the copy shown on the metric's own empty
 * state, and adding a new sub-page's source line is a one-place change
 * (write its `emptyState.description`; the catalog picks it up via the
 * same derivation the tab strip already uses for the pill label).
