/**
 * Metered provider chokepoint for the comprehensive-briefing tier.
 *
 * The status/reference tier funnels every generation through
 * `runStatusCompletion`, which reserves against the day's token ledger before
 * egress and reconciles after. The comprehensive briefing did not: both the
 * shared generator (`comprehensive-generate.ts`) and the on-demand
 * `POST /api/insights/generate` route called `runRawCompletionWithFallback`
 * directly, so none of that spend reached `coach_usage` and no daily ceiling
 * applied to it. The briefing is the single most expensive generation in the
 * product — a full feature snapshot in, a multi-section JSON payload out — and
 * it retries up to twice per run (JSON-shape retry, grounding-correction
 * retry), so an unmetered run could cost three full generations.
 *
 * This is the same accounting the status tier uses, not a second mechanism:
 * `reserveBudget` (one atomic upsert-increment, no read-then-write window) +
 * `resolveDailyCap(chain)` for the cost owner + `reconcileSpend` against the
 * provider's reported count. Every provider call on the briefing path routes
 * through here, so a retry is reserved and charged like any other call — a
 * user at the ceiling does not get a free correction pass.
 *
 * The cap follows the COST OWNER, not the surface. `resolveDailyCap` charges
 * the operator ceiling only when the chain's primary is the operator's own
 * credential (`admin-openai` / `admin-codex`); a self-hoster on their own key,
 * their own ChatGPT plan, or a local model is measured against the generous
 * user-plan ceiling, so their hardware is never rationed by the operator's
 * bill.
 *
 * Callers own the consent gate and MUST apply it before calling in — a
 * consent-blocked user must never have budget reserved against them, because
 * nothing is ever sent upstream on their behalf.
