/**
 * v1.13.x — the shared metric SIGNAL block.
 *
 * Every per-metric AI surface today sends the model raw graded buckets and
 * an instruction to "read the personal baseline from the means and compare
 * the two". That comparison is arithmetic an LLM does unreliably, and the
 * significance verdict ("is this inside my normal swing?") has no number to
 * anchor to — which is exactly where generic prose leaks in. The fix
 * (research-ai-quality.md §4) is a single token-lean, signal-RICH descriptor
 * that hands the model the comparison already finished:
 *
 *   metric · current · own baseline · signed delta (+%) · spread /
 *   normal-swing verdict · coarse normal-range placement · n / recency ·
 *   (for a composite score) the 1–2 biggest-moving contributors.
 *
 * This is "surface C" of the audit — the generic per-metric assessment base —
 * built first because it is also the per-score-assessment path.
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free: it folds data the snapshot builders already hold
 * (the graded series, `summarizeSeries`, the registry norms, the profile).
 * No DB read, no provider call. The deterministic per-score assessment writer
 * and the generic metric-status snapshot both build their signal from here, so
 * one builder is the single source of the comparison every surface used to
 * re-derive by hand.
