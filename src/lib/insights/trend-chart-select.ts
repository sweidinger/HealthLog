 * v1.8.5 — derive the Insights overview "Trends" chart set from the

 *
 * The Trends row used to be a fixed BP / weight / mood triple. The
 * briefing already surfaces the day's load-bearing findings (each one
 * tied to a `sourceMetric`), so the row should chart exactly those
 * flagged metrics — in the briefing's own priority order, deduped,
 * capped, with the legacy triple as the fallback when the briefing is
 * empty or unavailable.
 *
 * This module is the pure mapping layer:
 *   - `TREND_CHART_CONFIG` maps every briefing `sourceMetric` to a
 *     concrete chart descriptor (which measurement series to plot, its
 *     colour + unit + i18n title key, and whether the advisor supplies
 *     a one-sentence annotation for it).
 *   - `selectTrendCharts(briefing, opts)` walks the briefing findings,
 *     resolves each to a chart slot, dedupes, caps, and falls back to
 *     the default triple when nothing usable surfaces.
 *
 * Kept free of React/Recharts so the selection logic is unit-testable
 * in isolation and the renderer stays a thin consumer.
