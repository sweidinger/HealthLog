/**
 * v1.4.36 — SQL-driven aggregator for `/api/insights/comprehensive`,
 * rollup-first read with live-SQL fallback on cold mounts.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * The route previously pulled every measurement of every type from the
 * trailing 90 days into JS, then ran `summarize()` per type plus a
 * pile of in-JS correlation pairings. Post Apple-Health import the
 * unbounded `findMany` on line 49 of the old route routinely returned
 * 100 000+ rows and dominated request time (29 s in the v1.4.34 prod
 * HAR capture, with sibling endpoints cascading into 503s on pool
 * starvation).
 *
 * The shape mirrors the `summaries-slice` aggregator
 * (`src/lib/analytics/summaries-slice.ts`) the v1.4.33 C1 dashboard
 * tile strip already proved out: a single `$queryRaw` per surface,
 * grouped by `type`, with Postgres-side `AVG` / `MIN` / `MAX` /
 * `REGR_SLOPE` / `REGR_R2` against the index path
 * `measurements (user_id, type, measured_at)`. Difference vs. the
 * slim slice: the comprehensive endpoint also needs `anomalyCount`,
 * `avg30LastMonth`, `avg30LastYear`, and the 90-day window cap.
 *
 * Read-swap (v1.4.35 → v1.4.36)
 * -----------------------------
 * v1.4.35 landed a partial read-swap that ran both the live aggregate
 * AND the rollup read in parallel, then preferred the rollup-derived
 * values when the count matched. That left the regression intact: the
 * heavy `$queryRaw` over `measurements` still ran on every request,
 * still scanning the 311k-row table on a power-user account.
 *
 * v1.4.36 promotes the rollup table to the canonical source on the
 * happy path:
 *
 *   - On entry we call `ensureUserRollupsFresh` (warm-on-read populator
 *     for the trailing 90-day DAY window) and then probe the rollup
 *     table with a single COUNT.
 *
 *   - When the DAY rollup table has rows for this user the **heavy**
 *     `$queryRaw` over `measurements` is skipped. `count / min / max /
 *     mean` per type compose from the persisted DAY buckets via
 *     `aggregateBuckets`; `dailyByType` reads the same buckets keyed
 *     on `(type, bucketStart)`.
 *
 *   - A **narrow** `$queryRaw` still fires for the non-composable
 *     fields: `stddev`, `anomalyCount`, `avg7 / avg30 / avg30LastMonth`,
 *     and the `slope7 / slope30 / slope90` tuples. These don't compose
 *     linearly across DAY buckets so live SQL stays canonical, but the
 *     query no longer carries the redundant `COUNT(*)` / `MIN` / `MAX`
 *     / `AVG` columns that duplicated the bucket-derived values.
 *
 *   - `latest / latestMeasuredAt` keep their dedicated `DISTINCT ON
 *     (type)` pass; the bucket stores the day's mean rather than the
 *     last reading.
 *
 *   - Fallback path — when the COUNT probe returns zero rows
 *     (post-restart cold mount or a brand-new account whose boot-time
 *     backfill is mid-flight) we run the legacy heavy aggregate so the
 *     response shape is correct on the very first request.
 *
 * Scope notes
 * -----------
 *   - The 90-day window is preserved (the legacy `findMany` clamped on
 *     `measuredAt >= ninetyDaysAgo`). `min` / `max` / `mean` therefore
 *     describe the 90-day window, NOT the user's all-time range —
 *     identical to the old behaviour.
 *
 *   - For correlations:
 *       - **weight × BP**: directive accepts a daily-key swap from the
 *         old `pairByTimestamp` (24h default tolerance). Postgres
 *         joins on `date_trunc('day', measured_at)`.
 *       - **mood × {BP, weight, pulse}**: same daily-key shape the
 *         legacy code already used (the `buildMoodMetricPairs` helper
 *         bucketed by `toISOString().slice(0,10)`).
 *
 *   - BP target adherence (`bpPctInTarget`) keeps the 5-minute
 *     tolerance contract — that pairing is sys/dia within the *same*
 *     reading session. The aggregator pulls sys+dia raw rows (90d,
 *     bounded — typically <2k rows even for power users) so
 *     `pairByTimestamp` semantics survive byte-identical.
 *
 *   - `bpMedicationCorrelation` is computed in the route itself; the
 *     aggregator surfaces daily BP_SYS means via the same daily-join
 *     query so the medication block can pair compliance × systolic
 *     without a second findMany.
 *
 *   - Mood data still loads via `prisma.moodEntry.findMany` — that
 *     table is small (a row per user-recorded entry, bounded) and the
 *     `moodSummary` field calls `summarize()` against raw scores. The
 *     legacy route's `moodSummary` was built off raw rows so we keep
 *     the raw fetch.
 *
 * Output shape
 * ------------
 * The aggregator returns the bundle of pre-computed values the route
 * stitches into the final response. Helper functions inside the
 * aggregator collapse `$queryRaw` rows into the same `DataSummary`
 * shape `summarize()` would return.
