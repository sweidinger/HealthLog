/**
 * v1.8.5 — shared mood-aggregate computation.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the analytics the mood surface needs.
 * `mood-status.ts` (the LLM snapshot builder) and `/api/mood/insights`
 * (the visualization endpoint) both consume these pure functions so the
 * numbers the user sees match the numbers the model reasons over — no
 * drift between the prose and the charts.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function over already-fetched rows. The DB
 * read + orchestration lives in `fetchMoodAggregates` at the bottom;
 * the per-dimension helpers above it take plain arrays so they unit-test
 * without a database.
 *
 * v1.28.26 — the per-dimension calculators live in sibling modules
 * (`mood-tag-influence`, `mood-crosstab`, `mood-better-days`,
 * `mood-patterns`); this hub re-exports them all, so call sites keep
 * importing from here unchanged.
