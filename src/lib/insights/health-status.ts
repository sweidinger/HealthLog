/**
 * v1.25 — health-status / baseline-drift shaping.
 *
 * Surfaces what is drifting from the user's own normal by combining two
 * existing read-only engines:
 *   - the personal-band deviations from the coincident-deviation flag
 *     (`coincident-deviation.ts`, which fans `VITALS_BASELINE` across vitals),
 *     keeping only the vitals that sit OUTSIDE their band today, and
 *   - the dated, sustained level shifts from the changepoint detector
 *     (`changepoint.ts`).
 *
 * This module owns only the pure reshaping — taking the engine outputs and
 * folding them into the flat response the card reads — so the present / absent
 * states are unit-testable without Prisma. It never labels a cause and never
 * diagnoses; it lists what changed and frames it as awareness only.
