/**
 * Off-response classifier for WHOOP API replies.
 *
 * WHOOP signals failure through the HTTP status code itself (no `status` field
 * embedded in a 200 body), so the classification is status-driven. The shared
 * core lives in `src/lib/integrations/http-status-classifier.ts`; this module
 * re-exports it under the WHOOP-specific names callers already use.
 *
 *   - `success`         → HTTP 2xx
 *   - `transient`       → retryable: HTTP 429 (rate-limited — WHOOP caps at
 *                         100 req/min + 10 000 req/day per app), 5xx upstream
 *                         outages, 3xx CDN/network glitches, and an unknown
 *                         status where we never reached the envelope.
 *   - `reauth_required` → HTTP 401 / 403 — the access token is rejected or the
 *                         grant was revoked; the user must redo OAuth.
 *   - `persistent`      → any other 4xx (400, 404, 422, …) — a malformed
 *                         request or a contract mismatch that retrying without
 *                         operator intervention will not fix.
