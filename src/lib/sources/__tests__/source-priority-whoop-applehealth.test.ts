/**
 * v1.11.0 — cross-source priority verification when WHOOP and Apple Health
 * (and the COMPUTED recovery engine) populate the same metric for the same
 * day. The E-slice oracle: WHOOP feeds the existing two-axis picker via the
 * v1.11 ladder additions — no new selection engine.
 *
 * The recommended defaults (see `src/lib/validations/source-priority.ts`)
 * lead the recovery-input ladders with WHOOP (a worn-all-night strap has
 * higher-resolution overnight sampling than the iPhone-relayed HealthKit
 * summary), keep a real scale ahead of WHOOP's body-measurement estimate for
 * weight, and rank WHOOP's device-native Recovery above the COMPUTED proxy.
