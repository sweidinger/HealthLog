/**
 * v1.4.25 W17b/c — cross-source priority verification when both
 * Withings (activity + sleep v2 ingest) AND Apple Health (iOS
 * passthrough, v1.5) populate the same metric for the same day.
 *
 * The maintainer-directive default priority (W8c — see
 * `src/lib/validations/source-priority.ts`) picks APPLE_HEALTH first
 * for every cumulative metric (steps, active energy, walking-running
 * distance, flights climbed) because HealthKit aggregates iPhone +
 * watch + scale into a single canonical stream. Withings rows stay in
 * the DB as a complete shadow set — the picker just drops them from
 * the aggregation, not the persistence.
 *
 * Sleep stages add a per-row dimension via Migration 0055 — a single
 * night can carry 4–6 rows from Withings (per stage) AND 4–6 rows
 * from Apple Health (per stage). The picker must resolve per stage,
 * keeping the winning-source rows for every stage so the analytics
 * aggregator's per-stage sum doesn't double-count.
