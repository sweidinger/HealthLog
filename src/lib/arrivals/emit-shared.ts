/**
 * Generator-free enqueue contract for the `data-arrival` queue.
 *
 * Mirrors the `morning-digest-refresh-shared.ts` split exactly: queue name +
 * payload + `boss.send` live here, with NO import of the worker module, so a
 * sleep sync, a workout batch, or a lab write never drags the reaction tree
 * (and its transitive insight imports) into its own module graph. The worker
 * lives in `@/lib/jobs/data-arrival` and re-exports the queue name from here so
 * there is one source of truth.
 *
 * Cost discipline at the seam, because this code runs in front of every ingest
 * path in the product:
 *
 *   - Called ONCE per write batch, never per row. The caller passes the newest
 *     sample it inserted and how many rows it inserted; the spine never walks a
 *     batch.
 *   - No row reads. The only lookups are `resolveUserTimezone` and
 *     `resolveModuleMap`, both process-cached per user, and both already on the
 *     hot path of the seams this joins.
 *   - Fire-and-forget and fully try/caught. An emit failure can NEVER fail the
 *     ingest that called it — the discipline of `maybeEnqueueMorningRefresh`
 *     (`morning-refresh-trigger.ts`, its outer catch). Callers still
 *     `void emitDataArrival(...).catch(() => {})` for defence in depth.
 *   - Non-salient never reaches the queue. A backfill is annotated and dropped
 *     at the seam, so trigger volume is observable before any surface consumes
 *     the spine.
