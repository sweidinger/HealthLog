/**
 * P1 — `PriorityItem`, the ONE typed model behind every "worth a look" item.
 *
 * A `PriorityItem` is the single rendering unit for every rail entry the
 * unified daily-value system produces: a coach check-in, a dose-window CTA, a
 * Vorsorge nudge, a failed-sync retry, a durable milestone, a new-ECG pointer,
 * and an elevated-at-rest tension window. Later slices (Today rail S2, coach
 * check-in S3, ECG weave S10, milestones S12, tension S11) each add ONE `kind`
 * plus a server-side item builder — never a new component. `PriorityCard`
 * renders it; `buildDailyDigest` emits it.
 *
 * The type is deliberately WIRE-SERIALISABLE: the digest DTO crosses the
 * `GET /api/daily/digest` boundary (and, later, a native-client / iOS-widget
 * boundary), so an item carries no React component. The card derives its
 * Lucide glyph deterministically from `kind` (see `KIND_ICON` in
 * `src/components/daily/priority-card.tsx`) — the icon lives with the
 * renderer, the closed `kind` enum with the model. This is the one intentional
 * departure from the Fable §1.2 code block (which sketched `icon: LucideIcon`
 * inline); a serialisable single-source-of-truth DTO cannot hold a component.

 * reserved for the slices that own them (coach check-in S3, milestone S12,
 * new-ECG S10, tension window S11) so their consumers can already type against
