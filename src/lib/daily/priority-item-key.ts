/**
 * Deterministic identity keys for the dismissible (observational) Today rail
 * items — `milestone`, `ecg_new_recording`, `tension_window`. Pure string
 * formatting, no DB, no clock: both the digest composer (`./digest.ts`, which
 * stamps the key onto the emitted `PriorityItem`) and the IO seam
 * (`./load-digest.ts`, which needs the SAME keys to look up which of today's
 * candidates are already dismissed) import from here so the format is one
 * source of truth.
 *
 * Each key is namespaced `<kind>:...` (see `isDismissibleItemKey` in
 * `./priority-item.ts`) and folds in enough of the underlying candidate's own
 * identity that a fresh instance the NEXT day never collides with today's
 * dismissed one — a milestone by its reach day, an ECG recording by its own
 * timestamp, a tension window by the local day it was detected for.
