/**
 * P2 — `Milestone`, the durable-states reward primitive.
 *
 * A milestone is "a state REACHED" — a durable achievement the record now
 * carries: a metric that settled back inside the user's own range, a run of
 * weeks in range, a fresh personal best. It is deliberately NOT a streak.
 *
 * The distinction is written into the type on purpose: a milestone carries a
 * `sinceDate` (the day the durable state was reached) and NOTHING that counts
 * days still being maintained — no `currentRun`, no `daysHeld`, no counter a
 * future tuning pass could quietly turn into a flame. A missed day is invisible
 * here; there is no "you broke it" state to reach, and none is representable.
 *
 * This module is a THIN wrapper over the engines that already exist — it adds
 * no second detection framework:
 *   - `return_to_baseline` + `sustained_in_range` fold a `StreakResult` from
 *     the pure `detectStreak` engine (`@/lib/insights/streak-detector`).
 *   - `record_first` folds a `PersonalRecord` row (the `pr-detection` infra).
 *
 * Reached-once WITHOUT new storage: a milestone's `sinceDate` is a stable
 * historical fact. `selectFreshMilestone` admits it only on the day it was
 * reached (`sinceDate === todayKey`); the next day it is no longer fresh and
 * never resurfaces. No "which milestones were shown" table is needed — the
 * reached-date IS the once-guarantee.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no clock, no network. Day keys are UTC-ISO (`YYYY-MM-DD`), the
 * SAME space `readDayMeanSeries` and the rollup tier already emit, so a
 * milestone's reach-day and "today" compare in one consistent space.
