 * baseline engine, so importing a constant from it would drag the whole server
 * builder — and the Postgres driver — into a client bundle (a Turbopack
 * `Can't resolve 'net'/'tls'/'dns'` build failure). Keeping the constants here
 * lets the Today hero and the check-in hook import them with zero server reach.
