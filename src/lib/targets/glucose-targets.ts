/**
 * Diabetes-aware blood-glucose TARGET resolver (v1.18.6).
 *
 * One question: "what glucose band should THIS user be judged against on this
 * context, right now?" The answer depends on a single explicit, user-declared
 * preference — `User.hasDiabetes` — and NEVER on any reading. The flag is set
 * through Settings (`PATCH /api/auth/me/diabetes`); it is never inferred from
 * a value and never asserts a diagnosis.
 *
 *   - Flag OFF (default): the general non-diabetic normal bands — the existing
 *     behaviour, resolved by the shared reference-range resolver
 *     (`getEffectiveRange`, which owns the band display) so a user-override
 *     still wins and nothing about the calm-state UI changes.
 *   - Flag ON: the tighter ADA glycemic GOAL bands for people living with
 *     diabetes — fasting / pre-prandial 80–130 mg/dL, peak post-prandial
 *     < 180 mg/dL (ADA Standards of Care §6, stable 2024–2026). A user
 *     override still wins (a clinician may pin an individualised goal), but
 *     absent an override the diabetic goal band — not the normal band — is the
 *     target.
 *
 * The diabetic goal targets are GOALS, not screening thresholds: a fasting 80
 * is "in goal" for someone managing diabetes, where the non-diabetic 70–99
 * normal band would call the same reading low-normal. This is exactly why we
 * keep the two resolvers distinct rather than widening the general band.
 *
 * Pure given its inputs. The route resolves the flag + overrides and passes
 * them in. mg/dL throughout (HealthLog canonical store unit); display-time
 * conversion to mmol/L is the caller's job (`src/lib/glucose.ts`).

 * POSTPRANDIAL: floor 80 (avoid hypoglycemia), ceiling 180 (ADA peak
 *   post-prandial goal `< 180`; the inclusive 180 is the band edge).
 * RANDOM: a random spot reading is not a defined ADA goal context; the
 *   post-prandial goal is the most clinically defensible comparator (a random
 *   reading is most often post-meal). Use the same 80–180 band.
 * BEDTIME: ADA publishes no separate bedtime goal for adults; the ISPAD
 *   pediatric bedtime band (90–150) is the closest comparator and the slightly
 *   higher floor guards against nocturnal hypoglycemia. Kept identical to the
 *   non-diabetic bedtime band on purpose — the diabetic delta lives in the
