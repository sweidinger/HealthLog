        "v1.10.0 — scans a curated behaviour × outcome matrix (daylight / mood / glucose / BP / steps × sleep / HRV / resting HR / weight), lag-joins each behaviour day to the next day's outcome, runs Pearson with the exact Student-t p-value, and applies Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control across every tested pair. Only statistically-defensible pairs surface, each carrying n, r, p, and the BH-adjusted q. Descriptive, never causal. Gated by the operator `correlations` assistant surface.
