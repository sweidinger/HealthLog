/**
 * OpenAPI route table for the illness / condition journal (`/api/illness`).
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. The request
 * bodies + queries reuse the runtime Zod schemas from `@/lib/validations/illness`
 * so the wire contract stays single-source. Response shapes are declared here
 * to mirror the server-authoritative DTOs in `@/lib/illness/dto.ts` (the routes
 * serialise a decrypted `note` + flattened `symptoms` the input schemas don't
 * carry; iOS renders the DTO, it never recomputes it).
 *
 * The journal is a CONDITION journal, retrospective-only — never a
 * predictor/diagnoser. Every route is module-gated: an account that turned
 * the module off (or an operator-disabled instance) 403s with
 * `errorCode:"illness.disabled"` even with a valid Bearer token.
