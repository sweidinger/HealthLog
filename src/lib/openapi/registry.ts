/**
 * OpenAPI 3.1 base registry (v1.4.23 / Wave 4 F5a).
 *
 * Per the W1 stream-3 decision: `zod-openapi` (samchungy) reads Zod v4's
 * native `.meta()` metadata, so we annotate schemas in their original
 * validation files and register the route table here. The committed
 * spec at `docs/api/openapi.yaml` is regenerated via
 * `pnpm openapi:generate`; the CI gate in `.github/workflows/security.yml`
 * runs `pnpm openapi:check` to detect drift.
 *
 * The v1.4.23 baseline covers the 6-8 routes the v1.5 iOS app touches
 * (auth/login, auth/passkey/login-verify, auth/refresh, measurements
 * GET + POST + batch, devices POST, insights/comprehensive). Future
 * waves expand coverage organically as routes are touched. Once the
 * registry catches the rest of the hand-maintained spec, the CI gate
 * flips from `continue-on-error: true` to hard-fail.
 *
 * The registry is intentionally split:
 *   - `openApiBase` carries the static document scaffolding (info,
 *     servers, tags).
 *   - `buildOpenApiDocument` assembles the full spec by importing the
 *     registered route table from `./routes`. Routes live in their own
 *     file so additions don't touch the base.
