/**
 * Shared reconstructed-sleep-timeline builder.
 *
 * Some wearables (WHOOP v2, Polar) expose only per-stage DURATION totals for a
 * night — no per-stage onset timestamps and no hypnogram endpoint. Stamping
 * every stage total on the one sleep-END instant collapses the hypnogram into
 * overlapping spans that all touch the night's right edge. Since the API never
 * carries an order, both vendors RECONSTRUCT an ordered, contiguous timeline:
 * lay the stages back-to-back from sleep ONSET in a fixed physiological order,
 * emitting one timed row per segment with `measuredAt = that segment's END`.
 *
 * The ORDER is synthetic, so every laid segment is flagged `reconstructed:
 * true`; the night DTO advertises it and the UI labels such a night as an
 * approximate layout, never as measured stage timing. The reader's honesty
 * flag (`analytics/sleep-night.ts` `RECONSTRUCTED_TIMELINE_SOURCES`) carries
 * the same contract on the read side.
 *
 * This helper is the single source of the algorithm; each vendor `mapSleep`
 * keeps only its field-name → tuple normalisation (ms vs sec, source field
 * names) so the segment shape and externalId scheme can never drift between the
 * two synthetic-timeline vendors. Oura's measured 5-min hypnogram is a
 * different algorithm and does NOT use this helper.
