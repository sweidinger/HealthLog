 *   2. anything else — a pre-upgrade cookie carrying the row's cuid. Accepted
 *      ONLY while that row's `tokenHash` is still NULL.
 *
 * A migration-time backfill cannot work: the cookie already in the user's
 * browser is the cuid, and no token we generate server-side can be pushed into
 * it. Backfilling would sign out every logged-in user at deploy — the one
 * outcome this change must not cause.
 *
 * Upgrading a legacy row in place on next use was the other candidate and was
 * rejected as unsafe. A browser fires several requests in parallel, all
 * carrying the same legacy cookie; each would mint its own secret and race to
 * claim the row. Exactly one write can win, and the losers cannot learn the
 * winner's secret to re-emit it — the row stores only a hash. Whichever
 * response reached the browser last would decide the cookie, and if that was a
 * loser's, the user is signed out. A guarded update narrows the write but not
 * the outcome: a loser that declines to re-cookie leaves the browser holding a
 * legacy id the row no longer honours. The race has no correct resolution, and
 * its failure mode is precisely the forced logout we are avoiding.
 *
 * So legacy rows are left alone and simply live out the expiry they already
 * have — `getSession` withholds the sliding-expiry extension from them (see
 * there). That bounds the id-as-credential path to the 30-day session lifetime
 * from the deploy, self-draining, with no operator step and no backfill. Every
 * login from the deploy onward is on a secret immediately.
