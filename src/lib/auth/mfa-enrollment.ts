/**
 * Admin-enforced MFA policy — the forced-enrollment gate.
 *
 * The effective per-user requirement is the OR of an instance-wide policy
 * (`AppSettings.mfaRequired`) and a per-user override (`User.mfaEnforced`).
 * When MFA is required AND the account has NO active second factor (no
 * confirmed TOTP and no registered security key), the user is sent through a
 * forced-enrollment interstitial after sign-in until they enrol one.
 *
 * The gate is surfaced exactly like the onboarding gate: a non-httpOnly UX-hint
 * cookie (`hl_mfa_enroll`) the proxy reads without a DB round-trip. It is a
 * server-authoritative nudge, not a cryptographic wall — every issuing auth
 * surface and `/api/auth/me` recompute it from the DB, so a locally edited
 * cookie is corrected on the next data fetch. The user can always reach
 * `/settings/security` (and the enrollment APIs) to enrol, so nobody is locked
 * out; the operator/CLI escape hatch (`scripts/disable-mfa.ts`, toggling the
 * policy off) is the recovery path of last resort.
