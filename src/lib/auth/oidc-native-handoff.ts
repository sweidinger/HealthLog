/**
 * Native OIDC SSO session handoff (iOS#49).
 *
 * The web OIDC flow (`/api/auth/oidc/login` → IdP → `/api/auth/oidc/callback`)
 * ends in a session cookie. The native app is a Bearer-transport client and can
 * never consume a cookie. This module bridges the two: the callback mints a
 * one-time, PKCE-locked handoff code that rides ONLY the custom-scheme redirect
 * back to the app; the app exchanges it at `POST /api/auth/oidc/native/token`
 * for the standard native token bundle.
 *
 * v1.32.11 — the mint/consume core moved to `./native-handoff.ts` so the
 * first-party web-handoff login (iOS #65) shares the exact same single-use /
 * short-TTL / PKCE-S256 / replay-revoke semantics. This module keeps the OIDC
 * flow's compile-time constant + its callback builder and re-exports the shared
 * core so every existing OIDC call site is unchanged. The OIDC leg is `flow:
 * "oidc"`, which is the shared core's default — so nothing in the OIDC callback
 * or token route had to change.
