/**
 * v1.29.x — Oura Cycle Insights (`daily_cycle_phases`) → HealthLog's cycle
 * tracker, as an ADDITIONAL, SUBORDINATE source.
 *
 * Every other Oura collection (see `./sync`) writes `Measurement` rows,
 * which support multiple source rows per `(type, day)` and resolve a
 * canonical reading at READ time (`src/lib/analytics/source-priority.ts`).
 * `CycleDayLog` has no such ladder — it is ONE canonical row per
 * `(userId, date)` (`prisma/schema.prisma` — "the HealthKit sync unit + the
 * manual log-day surface"), and the shared write helper
 * (`src/lib/cycle/day-log-write.ts`) partial-merges a re-post's fields over
 * whatever is already stored REGARDLESS of source. Calling it here would let
 * an hourly Oura poll silently demote a user's own logged flow (e.g. a
 * manual HEAVY re-tagged LIGHT on the next tick) — the exact opposite of
 * "manual wins".
 *
 * So this module never touches the shared upsert helper. It only ever
 * CREATEs a day that has NO existing `CycleDayLog` row at all (any source),
 * and never updates a row it did not itself create. A day already owned by
 * this module (source = OURA) is left alone on re-sync too — the marker is
 * a fixed single-value hint (`flow: LIGHT`), not a corrigible reading, so
 * there is nothing to refresh. The whole path degenerates to a cheap
 * "create if absent, otherwise no-op".
 *
 * Gated behind the SAME two-layer cycle-module gate every other cycle
 * writer respects (`isCycleAvailableForUser`) so an operator-disabled
 * instance, or a user who turned cycle tracking off, never accumulates rows
 * from a background Oura poll. No `MenstrualCycle` span is ever created or
 * mutated here — mirrors the Apple Health importer precedent
 * (`src/lib/cycle/import-accumulator.ts`), which attributes day-logs to an
 * EXISTING cycle but never synthesises a new one from flow data either;
 * cycle-span creation stays an explicit user action
 * (`POST /api/cycle/period`).
