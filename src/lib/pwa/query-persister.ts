/**
 * Minimal IndexedDB-backed TanStack Query persistence (v1.18.6).
 *
 * No external persister dependency: a tiny IDB key/value store plus a manual
 * dehydrate-on-cache-change / hydrate-on-boot bridge. The goal is offline
 * READ value — an installed PWA opened offline hydrates the last cached
 * dashboard/series instantly instead of painting empty skeletons forever.
 *
 * Safety:
 *  - Only successful (`status: "success"`) query results are persisted.
 *  - A strict ALLOWLIST keeps everything except the low-sensitivity
 *    dashboard-offline families off disk. This is the privacy floor: a
 *    denylist would persist every family it didn't name (cycle, mood, illness,
 *    labs, coach, insights, medications, …) in plaintext. Only the dashboard
 *    snapshot, its resolved widget layout, and the measurement daily-series —
 *    the data the dashboard needs to paint last-known values offline — are
 *    eligible. Clinical / narrative families are never written to disk.
 *  - `clearPersistedQueryCache()` is called on every session END (logout AND
 *    the 401 / session-expiry redirect), so a shared device never leaks one
 *    account's cached data to the next once the session is gone.
 *  - The payload is stamped with the current user id; a restore whose stored
 *    marker doesn't match the live account discards + clears the cache rather
 *    than hydrating a foreign account's data.
 *  - Respects the centralised queryKey factory: it reads existing query keys,
 *    it never invents new ones.
