/**
 * v1.17.1 — onboarding goal slugs + dashboard seeding.
 *
 * The closed set of goal slugs the GoalsChipPicker offers, plus the
 * server-authoritative seeding that turns a goal selection into a
 * personalization signal: which dashboard tiles get promoted to the
 * top and made visible. Goals are NOT a clinical target store — the
 * targets surface (`/api/insights/targets`) is fully derived from
 * height/age/gender + clinical references. Their only leverage is
 * (a) dashboard tile pinning (here) and (b) reminder suggestions
 * (read by the reminders panel from `User.onboardingGoals`).
 *
 * One home for the slug enum so the API validation
 * (`/api/onboarding/step`), the client picker, and the seeding all
 * read the same source — same-key drift was the v1.4.16 dashboard-enum
 * bug class.
