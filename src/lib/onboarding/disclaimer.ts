/**
 * v1.18.6 (DISC-02) — the one-time medical-disclaimer acknowledgment version.
 *
 * Pinned per the `researchModeAcknowledged*` precedent: the user row stores
 * exactly which copy was acknowledged, so a future material wording change
 * can bump this constant to re-prompt. Keep it in lockstep with the
 * `onboarding.disclaimer.*` i18n copy — bump on a substantive text change,
 * not on a typo fix.
