/**
 * v1.16.7 — intent-based data prefetch for the medications page.
 *
 * The nav links already prefetch the route's JS chunk (next/link
 * default in production); what still serialised the first visit was
 * the data hop — the list query only fired once the page chunk had
 * mounted. Wiring this to the nav link's hover / touch / focus intent
 * puts `/api/medications` (the response carries the per-medication
 * `nextDueAt` due times) in flight while the navigation commits.
 *
 * v1.16.8 — the batched card-compliance read
 * (`/api/medications/compliance`) prefetches alongside the list, so the
 * compliance bars + the status line resolve in the same paint as the
 * cards instead of swapping in late. Two independent requests on
 * purpose: the list response must stay fast (the due line never waits
 * on a compliance ledger build), and the compliance prefetch rides the
 * same server-side cache cells the page query would warm anyway.
 *
 * The 15 s prefetch window only bounds how old a cache entry may be
 * before an intent re-fires the request — the mounted page query rides
 * the provider-default `staleTime` (5 min) and consumes whatever this
 * prefetch parked. The server caches both reads per user (60 s list /
 * 15 min compliance, each with an SWR window), so even a missed window
 * stays cheap.
