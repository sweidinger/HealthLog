/**
 * v1.7.0 W6 — unified dashboard first-paint snapshot hook.
 *
 * One client cell against `GET /api/dashboard/snapshot` that hydrates
 * every above-the-fold tile, replacing the legacy four-cell waterfall
 * (slim analytics + thick analytics + mood + widget layout). Three
 * properties matter:
 *
 *   - It is NOT gated on `isAuthenticated`. The server `requireAuth()`
 *     is the real gate (401 on a missing cookie); on the dashboard
 *     route the cookie is always present because `src/proxy.ts` has
 *     already passed the auth / onboarding redirect. Firing un-gated
 *     removes the `/api/auth/me` round-trip from the cold critical path
 *     (R-firstpaint §1a — the single biggest first-byte win).
 *   - `staleTime: 60_000` + `refetchOnMount: false` keep a
 *     return-to-dashboard within a minute a free cache hit.
 *   - `refetchOnWindowFocus: true` (v1.18.9) closes the background-sync
 *     freshness gap behind #38: a Withings / Apple-Health / iOS batch
 *     sync writes the user's data with NO client-side mutation event, so
 *     the snapshot keys are never invalidated and the dashboard only
 *     updated on the 120 s poll or a hard reload. Refetch-on-focus means
 *     returning to the tab after a sync surfaces the new readings within
 *     a frame. The `staleTime: 60_000` gate makes rapid focus toggles
 *     cheap (a refetch fires only once the slot is stale), and the warm
 *     server SWR cache (~180 s fresh TTL, `DASHBOARD_REFETCH_INTERVAL_MS
 *     + 60_000`) keeps the focus refetch sub-cost.
 *   - `refetchInterval: 120_000` + `refetchIntervalInBackground: false`
 *     keep an open dashboard live: an idle tab polls the snapshot every
 *     two minutes so freshly-synced Withings / HealthKit readings appear
 *     without a manual reload. The poll hits the warm ~180 s server cache
 *     cheaply and only triggers a sub-second rollup rebuild when the
 *     underlying data actually changed — never the LLM surfaces, which
 *     stay daily / pre-generated. The interval pauses while the tab is
 *     backgrounded.
 *   - The queryKey is the centralised factory entry
 *     `queryKeys.dashboardSnapshot()`.
