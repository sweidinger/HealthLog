/**
 * v1.4.34 IW-G — per-user cache invalidation helpers.
 *
 * Each write endpoint that touches a measurement / mood / medication /
 * dashboard-widget row calls the matching helper after its successful
 * database commit. The helpers walk the affected `caches.*` maps and
 * delete every key whose `userId` prefix matches.
 *
 * The "evict the whole user-bucket" stance is intentional: a redundant
 * eviction costs the next reader one cache miss (cheap, the row's
 * already paginated and the snapshot LRU sits behind), but an
 * under-eviction surfaces stale data which is the directive's failure
 * mode. The full per-write → per-cache fan-out is documented in the
 * blueprint §6 (`.planning/research/v1434-r-cache-aggregation.md`).
 *
 * The helpers are intentionally synchronous — they do `Map.delete()`
 * over a bounded entry set, which is cheap enough to run inline before
 * the write endpoint's `apiSuccess()` return. No `await` overhead.
