 * wall clock to its UTC instant via `zonedWallClockToUtc`.
 *
 * The offset is therefore settled AT THE TARGET local time, not at the
 * reference instant. The previous implementation sampled the offset at
 * `now` and applied it to the target, so on a DST-transition day the
 * answer depended on which side of the transition the reference sat:
 * a 20:00 slot resolved to 19:00 local when the caller ticked before the
 * Berlin autumn change and correctly when it ticked after. That broke
 * two contracts at once — the projector, the reminder worker and the
 * intake write path key on the byte-identical slot instant, and they
 * pass different reference instants for the same slot, so a duplicate
 * pending row became reachable on that day.
 *
 * `zonedWallClockToUtc` runs the same two-pass converge as
 * {@link startOfLocalDayInTz}, so `localHmAsUtc(x, tz, 0, 0)` now equals
 * `startOfLocalDayInTz(x, tz)` BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
 * coincidence — the two used to disagree by an hour on transition days,
 * which opened the one-shot on-time band an hour into the previous
