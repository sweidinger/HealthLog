/**
 * Structural guards on the Bearer-scope enforcement boundary.
 *
 * The correctness argument for the fail-closed default is structural, not
 * empirical: there is exactly ONE place a raw Bearer token becomes a user, and
 * exactly ONE authorisation arm inside it. Seven behavioural tests cannot cover
 * 300-odd routes; what they can do is rest on that invariant. These guards are
 * what keep the invariant true.
 *
 * They are tripwires, not proofs. They cannot show an allowlist is correct —
 * only that it has not changed without someone editing this file. A reviewer
 * who waves through a bad addition defeats all four, and no test substitutes
 * for that review.
