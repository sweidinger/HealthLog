/**
 * Structural guard on the AI consent boundary.
 *
 * Two surfaces shipped without a consent check — the self-context clarifying
 * questions and the AI-composed proactive nudge — for the same reason: nothing
 * connected "I am holding a live provider instance" to "I must have checked a
 * receipt first". Behavioural tests close the two we found. This closes the
 * class, so the third one cannot appear quietly.
 *
 * The invariant: a module that resolves a provider INSTANCE for a user
 * (`resolveProvider` / `resolveProviderChain` / `resolveProviderForTest`) holds
 * something it can call `generateCompletion` on. Every such module must also
 * pull in a consent helper — or sit on the allowlist below with a written
 * reason a reviewer signed off.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE — read this before trusting it:
 *
 *   - It is an IMPORT-level check. It proves a consent helper is in the
 *     module's scope, NOT that the gate is reached on every path through the
 *     file. A module could import `hasActiveConsentForSurface`, call it on one
 *     branch, and egress ungated on another; this guard stays green.
 *   - It cannot prove ORDER. A gate called after the provider call, or after
 *     the snapshot is built, passes here and is still wrong.
 *   - It cannot prove the SURFACE is right. Passing `"insights"` where the data
 *     is a Coach snapshot passes here.
 *   - It cannot prove an allowlist entry is HONEST. A reviewer who waves
 *     through a new entry with a plausible-sounding reason defeats it entirely.
 *     The allowlist is a review checkpoint, not a proof.
 *
 * What it does buy: a NEW ungated provider call site cannot land silently. The
 * author must either wire a consent helper or edit this file, and editing this
 * file puts the decision in front of a reviewer. That is the whole claim.
