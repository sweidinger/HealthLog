/**
 * Structural guard — every Prisma migration owns a unique numeric prefix.
 *
 * Migrations are named `NNNN_description`, and the four-digit prefix is the
 * ordering key. When two short-lived branches each grab the next free number
 * and both merge, the tree ends up with two `0268_*` directories. Prisma
 * applies them in lexical order, but the collision is a silent
 * merge-time hazard: a reviewer reading `git log` sees one number twice, and a
 * later renumber has to touch history. This test fails the build the moment a
 * prefix repeats, so the collision is caught at PR CI rather than after merge.
