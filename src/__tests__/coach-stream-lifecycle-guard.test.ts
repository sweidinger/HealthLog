/**
 * Structural guard for two Coach streaming-lifecycle invariants.
 *
 * These are STRUCTURAL assertions over the source text, not behavioural ones.
 * The repo ships no `@testing-library/react` / `renderHook`, so an unmount
 * cleanup and a tray-switch callback cannot be driven behaviourally here. A
 * structural guard is weaker than a behavioural test — it proves the code is
 * present, not that it works — but both defects were *deletions of a call*,
 * which is exactly what a structural guard does catch. Matches the existing
 * `*-guard.test.ts` precedent in this directory.
 *
 * Invariant 1 — `useSendCoachMessage` aborts its in-flight reader on unmount.
 * Without it, the full-page `/coach` surface (which passes no `registerReset`,
 * so the reset effect early-returns) left the SSE reader loop alive on a
 * route change: the provider kept generating and billing, and trailing
 * setState fired on an unmounted component. The drawer worked around this via
 * `handleOpenChange`; route-change unmount had no exit at all.
 *
 * Invariant 2 — switching conversations resets the send state. Without it the
 * previous thread's last assistant/error bubble rendered appended to the newly
 * selected thread until the next send, because `streamingActive` stays true
 * while that messageId is absent from the new thread's messages.
