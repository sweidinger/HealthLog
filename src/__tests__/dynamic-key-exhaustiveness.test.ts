/**
 * Enum-driven exhaustiveness guard for DYNAMICALLY-built i18n keys.
 *
 * The three existing i18n guards each see one face of the problem and miss the
 * fourth:
 *   - `i18n-call-site-coverage.test.ts` sees only literal `t("ns.key")` calls,
 *     so a runtime-assembled `t(\`ns.${x}\`)` key is invisible to it.
 *   - `i18n-reverse-coverage.test.ts` sees bundle orphans, but treats any
 *     `ns.${x}` template as covering its whole subtree — so a MEMBER missing
 *     from the subtree is invisible.
 *   - `i18n-locale-integrity.test.ts` sees cross-locale parity, so it only
 *     fires when a key is present in SOME locale but not all.
 *
 * None of them assert the class that actually ships broken: "for enum E, every
 * member's dynamically-built key resolves, non-empty, in every locale." Because
 * parity is perfect, a key missing from ONE locale is missing from ALL SIX at
 * once — exactly the seam that let `measurementReminders.types.{WHO5_SCORE,
 * SCI_SCORE,WAIST_CIRCUMFERENCE}` (v1.28.38) and `illness.vital.FUNCTIONAL_IMPACT`
 * (v1.28.41) ship absent from every bundle.
 *
 * This test derives the EXPECTED key set from the SOURCE enum/const and asserts
 * every `prefix + member` resolves. Adding an enum member without a bundle key
 * fails CI by construction — no hand-maintained floor to drift.
 *
 * ── Covered key spaces (source is a clean, finite, import-safe enum/const) ──
 *   - illness.vital.*            ILLNESS_SCAN_TYPES ∪ FUNCTIONAL_IMPACT_RETURN_KEY
 *   - illness.type.*             illnessTypeEnum
 *   - illness.lifecycle.*        illnessLifecycleEnum
 *   - records.allergies.category.*  allergyCategoryEnum
 *   - records.allergies.type.*      allergyTypeEnum
 *   - records.allergies.severity.*  allergySeverityEnum ∪ "NONE" sentinel
 *   - records.allergies.status.*    allergyStatusEnum
 *   - records.family.relationship.* familyRelationshipEnum
 *   - mentalHealth.instrument.*         } INSTRUMENTS i18nKey slugs
 *   - mentalHealth.instrumentSub.*      } (PHQ-9 / GAD-7 / WHO-5 / SCI —
 *   - mentalHealth.instrumentDescription.* } the WHO-5/SCI class that bit before)
 *
 * ── Deliberately EXCLUDED (would produce false positives) ──
 *   - `insights.workouts.sport.*` — the Strava render path stores a raw
 *     `sport_type` and the render site legitimately falls back to that raw
 *     string, so a "missing" key is a graceful degradation, not a broken token
 *     (audit LOW #2). Asserting it would fail on a path that is by-design lax.
 *   - `settings.sections.*.description`, `settings.ai.providerChain.types.admin-codex`,
 *     `insights.<metric>.emptyState.cta` — structurally unreachable behind a
 *     tsc-exhaustive map / a `!= null` guard / a server-only filter (audit LOW).
 *     Registering them would demand bundle keys for code paths users never hit.
 *   - `measurementReminders.types.*` — already exhaustively covered by
 *     `measurement-reminders/__tests__/type-labels-i18n.test.ts`; its source
 *     const lives in a client component, not a lib-level export.
 *   - Prisma cycle enums, medication/document/lab/nutrient catalogs — clean
 *     enums the audit flags as candidates; left for a follow-up extension. Add
 *     them here once their exact prefix→member mapping is confirmed 1:1 (the
 *     cycle cervix* prefixes and catalog slug maps need per-space verification
 *     to stay false-positive-free).
