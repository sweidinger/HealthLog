/**
 * v1.31.0 — the `/coach` URL launch params.
 *
 * The page is the full-page half of every cross-surface hand-off (push taps,
 * copied links, the drawer's maximize control), so the params it understands
 * ARE the contract. Two properties matter enough to pin:
 *
 *  - `?scope=` is parsed STRICTLY against the closed `CoachScopeSource` union.
 *    An unknown value is ignored SILENTLY — no error, no crash, no free-form
 *    string reaching the chat route where it would widen the snapshot scope.
 *  - `?workout=` seeds the workout scope, and yields to `?c=` (an existing
 *    thread) and `?doc=` (the hardened fenced transport, which must never be
 *    diluted by a second scope).
 *
 * The conversation surface is stubbed to a probe that records the props it was
 * handed, so these assert the resolved props rather than rendered text —
 * responsive classes have broken text-based queries in this repo.
