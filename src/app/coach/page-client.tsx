/**
 * v1.12.0 (Coach v2 #6) — full-page Coach conversation.
 *
 * Renders the exact same `<CoachConversation>` surface the drawer uses
 * (history + streaming thread + composer + provenance + settings) at
 * full width and height. There is no forked chat logic — the page is a
 * thin chrome wrapper around the shared surface.
 *
 * v1.18.0 — the route is a standalone top-level page (`/coach`), no longer
 * nested under `app/insights/layout.tsx`, so it renders in the standard
 * page chrome WITHOUT the Insights tab strip. It still sits inside the
 * authenticated `<AuthShell>` (which provides the `<CoachLaunchProvider>`
 * the bottom-right FAB drawer reopens through), so the page inherits the
 * same Coach feature gating as every other Coach surface. When the
 * operator's master flag is off or the user opted out, the page redirects
 * back to `/insights` rather than painting a dead chat shell.
 *
 * v1.18.10 (W4) — the page is now a single full-bleed conversation
 * surface: the inner panel chrome (the bordered/rounded card) is gone so
 * the chat is no longer a window-inside-a-window, and the top "back to the
 * drawer" minimize control is removed (pointless on the dedicated page —
 * the separate bottom-right FAB drawer is the compact surface). The chat
 * claims the full content width and the viewport height below the top bar.
 *
 * v1.18.11 (W11) — ChatGPT-style IA: the page drops its own header bar
 * AND the top conversation-history strip entirely. The composer is the
 * single control hub (leading `+` actions menu = new chat + open
 * conversations, settings deep-link, mic, send); conversation history is a
 * left slide-in drawer opened from that menu. The composer keeps one
 * constant, centred, max-width-capped column across the new-chat hero and
 * the active conversation. All of that lives in `<CoachConversation>`'s
 * page branch, so the page stays a thin gating + sizing wrapper.
 *
 * v1.19.1 (C1/C5) — the Coach now DEFAULTS to the new-chat hero, reversing
 * the v1.19.0 (W7) "always resume most-recent" default the maintainer
 * disliked. Resolution order on mount:
 *   - `?c=<id>` → open that specific thread (explicit deep-link, unchanged).
 *     The dedicated conversation-history page (`/coach/conversations`, added
 *     in v1.21.4) routes back here with `?c=<id>` when a row is selected.
 *   - `?c=new` or no param → the new-chat hero.
 *   - EXCEPTION: when the Coach has proactively written an UNREAD message
 *     (`/api/insights/coach/nudge-status` → `unread`), auto-open the
 *     most-recent thread so the user lands on what the Coach said.
 * The search-param read sits in a Suspense child so the client-bailout
 * never de-opts the route.
 *
 * 2026-07-17 UX-flows audit — the route understood only `?c=` / `?doc=`, so
 * every other cross-surface hand-off (a metric card's "ask about this", the
 * Today check-in's "Adjust", a workout detail's coach button) dropped its
 * context at the URL boundary and landed on a blank composer (F1-2 / F4-1 /
 * F6-1). Two additive params close that gap, both seeding the SAME props
 * `<CoachConversation>` already exposes for the drawer's suggested-prompt
 * chips — no new plumbing inside the conversation surface itself:
 *   - `?scope=<CoachScopeSource>` — narrows the snapshot the FIRST turn of a
 *     fresh conversation reads (validated against the closed enum; an
 *     unrecognised value is silently dropped rather than reaching the chat
 *     route with a free-form string).
 *   - `?ask=<text>` — seeds the composer prefill (mirrors `prefill` on the
 *     in-app `askCoach()` launch call). The user still reviews/sends it —
 *     this is a prefill, not an auto-send.
 * Both are ignored once `?c=` or `?doc=` pin an existing/scoped thread — scope
 * only ever applies to a fresh conversation's first turn.
