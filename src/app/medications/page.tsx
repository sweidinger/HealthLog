/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) medications page.
 *
 * `/medications` is a high-traffic surface whose above-the-fold content — the
 * medication cards — waited for the client `queryKeys.medications()` cell to
 * fetch `/api/medications` after hydrate, so the first paint flashed skeletons
 * before the list filled in. This wrapper runs the SAME cached read the API
 * route uses (`readMedicationsListCached`, the shared `caches.medications` SWR
 * cell) during SSR and hands it to TanStack through `HydrationBoundary`, so the
 * mounted list cell starts warm instead of skeleton-first.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard template):
 *  - The query key comes ONLY from the central factory — `queryKeys.medications()`
 *    is a deterministic zero-arg tuple, so the server-seeded key equals the
 *    client's `useQuery` key by construction (no window/locale param to drift).
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is exactly
 *    what the client `queryFn` produces from the wire ((await res.json()).data —
 *    Prisma `Date`s as ISO strings, Decimals as their JSON form), never a
 *    Date-carrying sibling that would poison the cell.
 *  - Module-gate parity: the client list query is gated on the `medications`
 *    module being on; skip the prefetch when it is off (the client cell is
 *    disabled then too, and the page renders nothing).
 *  - The client cell keeps `refetchOnMount: "always"` — it is a correctness
 *    gate, not a redundancy: a cross-device / cross-surface take/skip (the iOS
 *    app, a notification action, a second tab) produces no client mutation
 *    event, so the list must re-verify on every mount. With the prefetch in
 *    place the hydrated cards paint immediately and that refetch runs in the
 *    background — the "empty then fills" flash is gone WITHOUT dropping the
 *    freshness guarantee.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session, a module lookup hiccup, or a DB blip renders the
 *    page exactly as before this wrapper existed — the client cell owns the
 *    fetch. The prefetch is an accelerator, never a gate.
