/**
 * `DELETE /api/cycle/all` — one-click cycle hard-delete purge.
 *
 * Distinct from the per-row soft-delete (`DELETE /api/cycle/day-logs/{id}`,
 * which leaves a tombstone for the sync feed): this HARD-deletes every
 * cycle row the user owns — day-logs (and their symptom links, by cascade),
 * menstrual cycles, predictions, the cycle audit trail, and the cycle
 * reminder-delivery rows in the push-attempts ledger — so no dated
 * reproductive trace survives in Postgres (the post-Dobbs threat model). The
 * `CycleProfile` row is left in place (gate + settings keep working) but its
 * intent-revealing fields — goal + cycle/period/luteal priors — are reset to
 * neutral defaults, so no reproductive intent survives either.
 *
 * Gated (`cycle.disabled` 403) and owner-scoped. The purge action itself IS
 * audited (written after the transaction, so it survives) — its `details`
 * carry only counts, no reproductive content.
