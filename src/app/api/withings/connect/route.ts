/**
 * Redirects the user to Withings OAuth authorization page.
 *
 * v1.4.47 W6 — state is now a fully-random 22-character base64url
 * nonce backed by a 10-minute `WithingsOAuthState` row, rather than
 * the legacy `${user.id}:${random16}` shape. The cookie carries JUST
 * the nonce (no user id), the OAuth state URL param carries JUST the
 * nonce, and the callback resolves the user via the row's `userId`
 * column. Closes the v1.4.43 security audit L-1 finding where the
 * user id was recoverable from log entries / network captures.
 *
 * v1.4.48 L5 + L14 — endpoint is now rate-limited per-user (10 calls
 * per 60 s) so a logged-in user with valid creds can't spam ledger
 * rows for the full 10-min TTL window. The row-create call is wrapped
 * in try/catch; a transient DB glitch now lands on the existing
 * `/settings/integrations?withings=error&reason=connect` surface
 * instead of bubbling a 500. Both rate-limit and create-failure paths
 * redirect rather than returning JSON because the entry point is a
 * browser navigation — a 429 envelope would surface as a blank page.
 *
 * v1.29.x — the no-credentials branch redirects too, matching every
 * other failure path in this route. It used to return a raw JSON 400,
 * which every browser navigation into this route (onboarding's
 * "Connect Withings" tap included) surfaced as an unstyled JSON page —
 * the first "connect a device" moment for a brand-new self-hoster.
