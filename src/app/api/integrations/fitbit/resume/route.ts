/**
 * Manual resume endpoint for a parked Fitbit / Google Health integration.
 *
 * Background: the `parked` state lives in
 * `src/lib/integrations/status.ts`. Once a Fitbit persistent-failure
 * streak has been running for more than 24h, the status writer flips
 * the row to `parked` and the sync entry-point short-circuits. The user
 * (or an operator) calls this endpoint to clear the park and let the
 * next cron tick attempt the sync again.
 *
 * Rate-limited (5/min per user) to match the existing
 * `/api/integrations/fitbit/test` endpoint — there's no upstream call
 * here, but a misbehaving client tab loop would still rack up
 * audit-log rows if the limit was absent.
 *
 * Returns 200 with `{ resumed: true, wasParked: boolean }`. The
 * `wasParked` flag lets the caller decide whether to surface a "you
 * resumed it" toast or treat the action as a no-op (the row was
 * already connected / disconnected). Mirrors the WHOOP resume route.
