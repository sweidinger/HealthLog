/**
 * v1.4.43 W14 — manual resume endpoint for a parked Withings
 * integration.
 *
 * Background: B4 introduced the `parked` state in
 * `src/lib/integrations/status.ts`. Once a Withings persistent-failure
 * streak (contract-mismatch 293/294) has been running for more than
 * 24h, the status writer flips the row to `parked` and the sync
 * entry-point short-circuits via `isReauthRequired`. The user (or an
 * operator) calls this endpoint to clear the park and let the next
 * cron tick attempt the sync again.
 *
 * Rate-limited (5/min per user) to match the existing
 * `/api/integrations/withings/test` endpoint — there's no upstream
 * call here, but a misbehaving client tab loop would still rack up
 * audit-log rows if the limit was absent.
 *
 * Returns 200 with `{ resumed: true, wasParked: boolean }`. The
 * `wasParked` flag lets the caller decide whether to surface a "you
 * resumed it" toast or treat the action as a no-op (the row was
 * already connected / disconnected). Either way the endpoint is
 * idempotent — a second click in the same second sees the same
 * post-state and writes no extra audit row.
