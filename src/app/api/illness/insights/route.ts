/**
 * `GET /api/illness/insights?windowDays=365` — the cross-episode retrospective
 * summary: "sick N times this year · typical recovery gap X days", with a
 * recurrence-by-month tally and a per-type breakdown.
 *
 * RETROSPECTIVE ONLY — it summarises past episodes. It is NEVER a predictor or
 * diagnoser; the recurrence figure is a count, not a forecast. Server-
 * authoritative + gated: the "typical gap" is withheld below the signal-
 * density floor (asserts nothing thin). Per-episode gaps come from the same
 * coverage-gated correlation engine the per-episode route uses, so a thin
 * episode contributes no gap rather than a wrong one. Born-gated + owner-
 * scoped.
 *
 * LAZY BY DEFAULT — the recovery-gap is the only expensive part (a bounded
 * per-episode correlation fan-out). The illness LIST loads with
 * `includeRecoveryGap` unset, so it pays only for a single count query and
 * paints fast; the gap is computed solely when the user opens the explicit
 * "Analyse" expansion (`includeRecoveryGap=true`). With it off the summary
 * returns the count breakdown and a null typical-gap.
