/**
 * `GET /api/illness/episodes/{id}/correlation` — the retrospective correlation
 * findings for one episode: the pre-onset anomaly scan ("how did it announce
 * itself"), the nadir / what-dropped, and the recovery-gap (physiological
 * return-to-baseline vs the felt-better marker).
 *
 * Server-authoritative + coverage-gated: the response is a `Derived<T>` flat
 * wire shape (`status: "ok" | "insufficient"`). When the signal is thin the
 * engine returns `insufficient` with coverage + a reason — the surface renders
 * "we're still learning", never a fabricated number. The findings are derived
 * from the user's OWN baseline (median ± MAD), never a population constant, and
 * the baseline window is contamination-guarded (ends before the pre-onset
 * lookback). Retrospective ONLY — never a predictor or diagnoser. Born-gated +
 * owner-scoped.
