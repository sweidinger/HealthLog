/**
 * Document vault: serve a document's encrypted preview thumbnail.
 *
 * The thumbnail is a small JPEG (~320px long edge) rendered in the background
 * from the original and stored encrypted at rest
 * (`DocumentThumbnail.thumbnailEncrypted`, AES-256-GCM). This route is the ONLY
 * path that decrypts and serves it. Owner-scoped + module-gated; the bytes are
 * PHI: never logged, never served cross-user, fail-closed on a decrypt error.
 *
 * Serving posture is fixed and singular: we only ever store JPEG, so the
 * response is always `Content-Type: image/jpeg` + `nosniff` — zero
 * misclassification surface, no `attachment` branch. It is loaded as an `<img>`
 * subresource on the vault page (governed by the page CSP `img-src 'self'`), so
 * it needs NO proxy carve-out — unlike `/original`, which is framed.
 *
 * A cache MISS (no thumbnail row yet — freshly uploaded, still rendering, or an
 * unsupported type) is a 404; the card falls back to its kind icon. The route
 * never generates synchronously, preserving the async never-block contract.
