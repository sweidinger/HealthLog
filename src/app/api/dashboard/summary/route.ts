/**
 * GET /api/dashboard/summary
 *
 * Aggregator endpoint for the iOS DashboardSummary view. Combines
 * greeting, intake-day streaks, today's medication compliance, the
 * highlighted insight, and per-metric latest+sparkline+trend.
 *
 * The shape is fixed for the iOS client and intentionally normalised —
 * `kind` is iOS-friendly (camelCase), unlike the canonical Prisma enum
 * (BLOOD_PRESSURE_SYS etc.).
 *
 * Cold-mount performance (v1.4.38 W-F)
 * ------------------------------------
 * The legacy shape ran an unbounded `prisma.measurement.findMany` over
 * the trailing 7 days plus a second unbounded `findMany` over the
 * trailing 365 days for the streak-day set. On a power-user account
 * (Apple Health step samples ≈ thousands per day) those two queries
 * dominated the wall-clock at ~4.6 s cold even though the DOWNSTREAM
 * JS code only ever needed:
 *   - the latest value per type within the 7-day window
 *   - a small sparkline (≤7 daily aggregates) per type
 *   - the set of YYYY-MM-DD day-keys with any activity in 365 days
 *
 * v1.4.38 swaps the two unbounded reads for SQL aggregates:
 *   - `DISTINCT ON (type)` → one row per type carrying the latest
 *     value + measuredAt (≤ N_metrics rows). REG-11 (v1.4.44) dropped
 *     the trailing-7-day window from the WHERE clause; the tile now
 *     surfaces the all-time-latest reading per type so a 60-day-old BP
 *     measurement still feeds the tile (paired with the stale-caption
 *     hint built off `lastSeenAt`).
 *   - `measurement_rollups` DAY buckets keyed `(user_id, granularity,
 *     bucketStart)` → at most 7 buckets per metric × N_metrics rows.
 *     Sparkline points become the bucket means rather than individual
 *     raw samples, which is a *smoother* trend signal for high-volume
 *     metrics like ACTIVITY_STEPS and bounded for every other metric.
 *     REG-11 (v1.4.44) switched the calendar-window filter for a
 *     `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY bucket_start
 *     DESC)` window so the sparkline takes the last `SPARK_DAYS`
 *     buckets per type regardless of age.
 *   - `SELECT DISTINCT date_trunc('day', measured_at)::date` over the
 *     365-day window → at most 365 dates (vs. up to 100k raw rows).
 *
 * The whole response is wrapped in the 60 s analytics LRU cache so
 * subsequent iOS polls inside the window hit memory. Invalidation runs
 * via the existing `invalidateUserMeasurements` + the v1.4.38-extended
 * `invalidateUserMedications` hooks.
