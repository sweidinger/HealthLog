/**
 * Redirect the user to the WHOOP OAuth authorization page (v1.11.0; native
 * enhancements v1.12.2).
 *
 * Mirrors the Withings connect route: a fully-random base64url state nonce
 * backed by a 10-minute `WhoopOAuthState` ledger row carries the
 * `(nonce → userId)` mapping, so the user id never travels in the OAuth
 * `state` param (which can land in request logs / network captures). The
 * httpOnly + Secure cookie carries JUST the nonce; the callback resolves the
 * user via the row's `userId`.
 *
 * v1.12.2 — two native-client enhancements:
 *   - `?ticket=<opaque>` lets a purely Bearer-authenticated native client (no
 *     web-session cookie) start the handshake. The connect route resolves the
 *     user from a one-time, unconsumed/unexpired ticket IN LIEU of a cookie,
 *     consumes it, and proceeds exactly as the cookie path. Expired / consumed
 *     / invalid → typed 401. The ticket is minted via the Bearer
 *     `POST /api/whoop/connect/ticket` route.
 *   - `?return_scheme=<custom-scheme>` (validated against a strict allowlist)
 *     is stored on the state row so it survives the OAuth round-trip; the
 *     callback uses it to send its FINAL redirect to a native custom scheme.
 *
 * Rate-limited per user (10 calls / 60 s) so a logged-in session can't spam
 * ledger rows for the full 10-min TTL window. Both the rate-limit and
 * create-failure paths redirect (not JSON) because the cookie entry point is a
 * browser navigation — a 429 envelope would surface as a blank page. The
 * no-credentials branch redirects too (v1.29.x), matching Withings — only the
 * ticket-invalid branch stays a typed 401 JSON response, since that path is
 * consumed by a native client, not a browser navigation.
