/**
 * v1.18.0 — module API route gate inventory.
 *
 * The v1.18.0 module retrofit can hide a toggleable module across the
 * nav, dashboard tiles, Insights pills, reminder jobs, doctor-report
 * sections, and the AI surfaces. The ONE server-side enforcement point
 * is `@/lib/modules/gate` — `requireModuleEnabled(userId, key)` in API
 * routes, `isModuleEnabled` / `resolveModuleMap` in builders + jobs +
 * components. Without a discovery test, a future contributor who lands a
 * new per-domain route for a toggleable module (a new mood-analysis read,
 * a new sleep view, a new glucose panel) would have to remember the gate
 * by hand. A silent miss leaks the surface over a Bearer token even when
 * the account — or the operator — turned the module off.
 *
 * This test walks every per-domain route tree that serves a TOGGLEABLE
 * module and pins each `route.ts` into exactly one of these buckets:
 *
 *   1. MODULE-GATED — the file calls `requireModuleEnabled(...)` for the
 *      right key (mood / sleep / glucose / workouts / recovery / labs /
 *      achievements). This is the direct gate.
 *
 *   2. DELEGATED — the module's enabled-state is owned elsewhere and the
 *      route gates on that single source of truth instead of re-deriving
 *      it (no double source of truth, mirroring the registry's
 *      `delegatesTo`):
 *        - cycle  → `requireCycleEnabled(...)` (the cycle gate the
 *                   `cycle` ModuleKey delegates to).
 *        - coach  → `requireAssistantSurface("coach")` (the assistant
 *                   master flag + per-user opt-out the `coach` ModuleKey
 *                   delegates to). Covered in depth by the sibling
 *                   `coach-route-gate-inventory.test.ts`; listed here so
 *                   coach-bearing routes are not flagged as ungated.
 *
 *   3. BUILDER-GATED — the route delegates its whole payload to an
 *      aggregator that resolves `resolveModuleMap(userId)` once and
 *      excludes disabled-module sections/resources from the build
 *      (`collectDoctorReportData`, `loadFhirContext`). The exclusion is
 *      structural at the builder, so the route carries no per-key call.
 *
 *   4. EXEMPT — an explicit, COMMENTED allowlist of routes that serve a
 *      toggleable domain but are deliberately NOT gated, each with the
 *      reason at the entry. The two reasons in play:
 *        - DATA LAYER: raw CRUD over the domain's own rows. Writing or
 *          reading a disabled module's data is harmless — the module gate
 *          governs whether the domain SURFACES (nav, tiles, analysis,
 *          reports), not whether the row store accepts writes. Disabling
 *          a module must not wedge an importer / sync / the user's ability
 *          to clean up data, and re-enabling must find the data intact.
 *        - INFRA / UI-ONLY: settings, availability probes, and the static
 *          FHIR CapabilityStatement carry no module data.
 *
 * Anything that doesn't fit one of the four buckets is an orphan and
 * fails the test BY NAME so the fix is one search-and-add: gate the route
 * or move it onto the EXEMPT allowlist with a documented reason.
