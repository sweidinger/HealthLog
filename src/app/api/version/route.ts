// resolver uses for the runtime fallback gate, so the public state and
// the runtime behaviour cannot disagree. The check hits the filesystem

// the route to be dynamic — the previous `force-static` setting would
// have frozen the answer at build time.

/**
 * GET /api/version
 *
 * Public endpoint exposing the running build's version. Used by the
 * Settings → About surface, the footer of every page, the
 * "Check for updates" button (which compares against the GHCR API),
 * and the admin status-summary row that surfaces the offline-geo
 * availability state.
 *
 * The build SHA and built-at timestamp come from environment variables
 * baked at image build time:
 *   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_BUILD_SHA` — short Git SHA, set by the
 *     `docker-publish` workflow.
 *   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_BUILT_AT` — ISO-8601 build timestamp, same
 *     workflow.
 *
 * For local `pnpm dev` neither is set; the route returns `null` and
 * the UI falls back to "development" wording.
 *
 * `offlineGeoEnabled` is `true` when the GeoLite2-City MMDB is present
 * at the configured `GEOLITE2_DIR` and no `.empty` marker is set.
 * When `false` the runtime falls back to the online provider named by
 * `geoProviderHost` (the host of `IP_GEO_LOOKUP_URL`, default
 * `ipwho.is`) and the resolver emits a one-shot admin notification on
 * first use. `geoProviderHost` lets the admin status surface name the
 * real provider instead of assuming the default.
