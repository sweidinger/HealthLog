/**
 * v1.4.38 W-C M6 — Coach API route gate inventory.
 *
 * The web surfaces are protected by the `flags.coach` short-circuit in
 * every Coach-bearing component (see
 * `src/lib/feature-flags/__tests__/coach-cascade.test.tsx`). The
 * server-side mirror is `requireAssistantSurface("coach")` in every
 * Coach-only route handler. Without a discovery test, a future
 * contributor who lands a new `/api/insights/<foo>/route.ts` whose body
 * touches the Coach stack would have to remember the gate by hand — a
 * silent miss leaks the surface even when the operator turned the
 * Coach matrix off.
 *
 * The walk below scans every `route.ts` under `src/app/api/insights/`
 * and groups each handler into one of three buckets:
 *
 *   1. Coach-gated   — file imports + invokes
 *                      `requireAssistantSurface("coach")`.
 *   2. Other-gated   — file invokes `requireAssistantSurface()` with a
 *                      different surface (`insightStatus`,
 *                      `correlations`, `briefing`, `healthScoreExplainer`).
 *   3. Allowlisted   — non-Coach Insights routes that don't gate on
 *                      the matrix at all (provider chain, settings,
 *                      targets, glp1-timeline, feedback). Allowlist
 *                      lives alongside the test for easy review.
 *
 * Anything that doesn't fit one of the three buckets is an orphan and
 * fails the test by name so the fix is one search-and-add.
