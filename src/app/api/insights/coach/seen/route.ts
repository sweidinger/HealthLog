/**
 * POST /api/insights/coach/seen — mark every Coach message as read.
 *
 * v1.18.6 (CCH-03) — opening the Coach (drawer or full page) clears the
 * unread dot on the FAB. The open stamps `User.coachLastSeenAt = now`;
 * the FAB's `GET /api/insights/coach/nudge-status` then reads no
 * assistant message newer than the stamp and drops the dot. Server-
 * authoritative so the cleared state follows the user across web + iOS,
 * not just the device that opened the Coach.
 *
 * No request body — the timestamp is server-minted from `now()` so a
 * client can never backdate the stamp to suppress a future nudge.
