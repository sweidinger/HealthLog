/**
 * GET    /api/insights/coach/facts — list the caller's ACTIVE Coach facts.
 * DELETE /api/insights/coach/facts — "forget all": soft-delete every active
 *                                    fact for the caller.
 *
 * v1.11.1 — the GDPR / "forget what you know about me" surface for the
 * durable Coach facts the assistant extracts during conversations. Facts
 * are server-extracted, not user-authored, so this surface is read +
 * delete only (no POST / PATCH).
 *
 * Ownership: every query is scoped `where: { userId, ... }`, so a caller
 * can only ever see or clear their own facts. The fact text is decrypted
 * on the fly; an undecryptable row (e.g. a key rotated out of the map) is
 * skipped rather than 500ing the whole list — the surface stays available
 * for the rows that DO decrypt.
 *
 * Coach-gated: a fact only exists because the Coach extracted it, so the
 * management surface sits behind the same `requireAssistantSurface("coach")`
 * kill-switch as the rest of the Coach stack.
