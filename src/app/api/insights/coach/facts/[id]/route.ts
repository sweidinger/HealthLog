/**
 * DELETE /api/insights/coach/facts/[id] — soft-delete one Coach fact.
 *
 * v1.11.1 — the per-fact "forget this one thing" delete for the durable
 * Coach facts surface.
 *
 * Ownership + existence privacy: the soft-delete uses `updateMany` scoped
 * `where: { id, userId, deletedAt: null }` rather than `update`. A
 * cross-user id, an unknown id, or an already-deleted fact all resolve to
 * a `count: 0` no-op — the route returns `200 { deleted: false }` and
 * never reveals whether the id exists under another account. The matching
 * convention is the idempotent-delete one used elsewhere in the tree
 * (a not-found delete is a successful no-op, not a 404).
 *
 * Coach-gated: same `requireAssistantSurface("coach")` kill-switch as the
 * collection route.
