/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) dashboard page.
 *
 * The measured first-load gap on `/` was never the server: FCP painted the
 * SSR skeleton shell at ~1.8 s but LCP landed at ~5.5 s (mobile-throttled)
 * because the real above-the-fold content waited for the full JS download +
 * hydrate + CLIENT-side fetches. This wrapper runs the same cached reads the
 * routes use during SSR and hands them to TanStack through `HydrationBoundary`,
 * so the first HTML already carries real content and the mounted cells start
 * warm instead of skeleton-first:
 *
 *  - the dashboard snapshot (`/api/dashboard/snapshot`) — every tile;
 *  - the Today digest (`/api/daily/digest` → `loadDailyDigest`) — the hero;
 *  - the batched chart series (`/api/measurements/series-batch` →
 *    `readSeriesBatch`) — the chart row.
 *
 * Contract notes:
 *  - Query keys come ONLY from the central factory. Every dehydrated VALUE is
 *    JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is exactly what the client
 *    `queryFn` would produce from the wire ((await res.json()).data — Dates as
 *    ISO strings), never a Date-carrying sibling that poisons the cell.
 *  - The batched-series key is the crux: the CSV type list comes from the
 *    SHARED `deriveBatchChartTypes` over the SAME snapshot payload, and the ISO
 *    window from `computeBatchWindow(now, user.timezone)` threaded to the
 *    client as the `batchWindow` prop. Server and client build the identical
 *    key by construction, so the prefetched slice lands instead of refetching.
 *  - Module-gate parity: the digest route gates on `insights`; skip its
 *    prefetch when the module is off (the client hook is disabled then too).
 *  - Fail-soft: no session, a builder hiccup, or a DB blip renders the page
 *    exactly as before this wrapper existed — the client cells own the fetch.
 *    Each prefetch is independent; one failing never blocks the others.
