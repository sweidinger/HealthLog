/**
 * RFC 9728 — OAuth Protected Resource Metadata for the `/mcp` resource.
 *
 * Public, unauthenticated discovery (added to the proxy `.well-known` allowlist).
 * A remote MCP client reads this after the `/mcp` 401 to learn which
 * Authorization Server backs the resource and what scopes it accepts. The
 * `resource` value is the canonical `/mcp` URI and MUST match the URL the user
 * pasted into Claude.ai / ChatGPT.
