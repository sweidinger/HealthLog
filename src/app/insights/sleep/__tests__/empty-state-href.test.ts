/**
 * v1.17.0 — the sleep empty-state CTA must point at a REAL settings slug.
 * It previously linked to `/settings/data-sources`, which is not in
 * `SETTINGS_SECTION_SLUGS`, so the dynamic `[section]` route calls
 * `notFound()` → a 404 dead-end. This pins the href to the `integrations`
 * slug and guards against a regression to any non-existent slug.
