/**
 * v1.17.1 — `/insights/recovery`.
 *
 * The render host for the WHOOP / Polar device-native recovery + strain scores
 * that were stored end-to-end but had no page: day strain, workout strain, ANS
 * charge, cardio load, and the day's whole-cycle average / max heart rate and
 * kilojoule energy expenditure. The composite RECOVERY_SCORE keeps its anatomy
 * detail at `/insights/scores/recovery`.
 *
 * v1.18.1 (B1–B3) — the page now follows the canonical per-metric structure:
 * each present signal renders a block carrying a short explainer, the
 * max / median / mean stat strip, the same chart with the 7 / 30 / 90 / All
 * toggle, and a per-chart assessment. The redundant top "Recovery score"
 * cross-link is removed (reached from the overview already).
 *
 * Every block is data-gated inside `<RecoverySection>`, so an account without a
 * strap / ring sees only the calm empty note. Server-authoritative: the charts
 * render stored values, never a recompute.
