/**
 * v1.12.4 — canonical metric-detail spine guard.
 *
 * v1.12.6 — the unified subpage spine is: intro → stat strip → chart →
 * target card → assessment. The stat strip moved ABOVE the chart (the
 * shell renders the `statStrip` prop before `children`); the assessment
 * stays the LAST content block the page hands to `<SubPageShell>` as
 * `children`. This source-order guard is unaffected by the render-position
 * move because `statStrip` is a prop on the opening tag and the assessment
 * is still the final child element. The generic `HealthKitMetricPage` scaffold enforces
 * this for the ~29 HealthKit pages structurally; the bespoke pages each
 * hand-write their body, so a future edit can silently slot a card after the
 * assessment (as `mood` and `medications` did before).
 *
 * This is a source-level structural guard:
 *   1. the assessment card element is the last JSX child of `<SubPageShell>`;
 *   2. the target card (`MetricTargetSummary`) precedes the assessment;
 *   3. the retired range row (`MetricRangeControls`) and the retired
 *      "Letzte Messung" card (`MetricLastMeasurementCard`) appear nowhere.
 *
 * Asserting on the source (rather than rendered markup) keeps the test
 * deterministic — the preceding blocks all self-suppress on a data miss, so a
 * render-order assertion would depend on mocking the whole data layer.
