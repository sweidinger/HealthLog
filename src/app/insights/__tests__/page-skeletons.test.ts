/**
 * v1.4.43 W11 — insights mother-page dynamic-skeleton guards.
 * v1.11.3 — rewritten for the shared `BlockSkeleton` loader.
 *
 * The `next/dynamic` loading placeholders for the below-the-hero blocks
 * used to be bespoke `<div className="… h-[Xrem] animate-pulse …
 * motion-reduce:animate-none" />` snippets with hard-coded guessed
 * heights. Those fixed heights pinned each placeholder taller or shorter
 * than the resolved block, so the page CLS-shifted as each chunk landed.
 *
 * E1 collapses all six loaders onto a single shared `BlockSkeleton` that
 * routes through the `Skeleton` primitive (which carries
 * `motion-reduce:animate-none`) and holds the row open with a `min-h`
 * floor rather than a fixed `h-[Xrem]`. This guard pins the new contract:
 * every loader uses `BlockSkeleton`, none re-introduces a hard-coded
 * fixed height, and the decorative (un-mountable) cards stay `aria-hidden`.
 *
 * The check is intentionally textual — render-mounting the page would haul
 * in TanStack-Query / Auth / I18n scaffolding for a property a substring
 * search already proves.
