/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) workouts list page.
 *
 * `/insights/workouts` is the workouts surface. Its above-the-fold content —
 * the workout rows — waited for the client `useWorkouts({ limit: 100 })` cell
 * to fetch `/api/workouts?limit=100` after hydrate, so the first paint flashed
 * the loading skeleton before the list filled in. This wrapper runs the SAME
 * cached read the API route uses (`readWorkoutsListCached`, the shared
 * `caches.workouts` projection cell) during SSR and hands it to TanStack
 * through `HydrationBoundary`, so the mounted list cell starts warm instead of
 * skeleton-first.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard / v1.30.13 medications template):
 *  - The query key comes ONLY from the central factory. The client cell keys on
 *    `queryKeys.workoutsRecentList({ limit: 100, offset, since, sportType })`
 *    with `offset` / `since` / `sportType` all `undefined`, so this seeded key
 *    is built from the same factory call with the same argument shape — the
 *    server-seeded key equals the client's `useQuery` key by construction.
 *  - The projection filter matches the route's too: all-null filter params hash
 *    to the same `userId|||` projection cache slot a `?limit=100` request
 *    builds, so the prefetch and the API path share one dedup pass.
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is exactly
 *    what the client `queryFn` produces from the wire ((await res.json()).data —
 *    Prisma `Date`s as ISO strings), never a Date-carrying sibling that would
 *    poison the cell.
 *  - Module-gate parity: the client page bounces a workouts-off account
 *    (`useModulePageGuard`), and the API route refuses it server-side; skip the
 *    prefetch when the module is off so a disabled page never seeds a cache it
 *    will not read.
 *  - The client cell keeps its own fetch (`staleTime: 60s`): the prefetch seeds
 *    fresh data, so the mounted cell paints immediately and only refetches once
 *    the TTL lapses — the "empty then fills" flash is gone without dropping the
 *    freshness path.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session, a module lookup hiccup, or a DB blip renders the
 *    page exactly as before this wrapper existed — the client cell owns the
 *    fetch. The prefetch is an accelerator, never a gate.
