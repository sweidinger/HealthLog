/**
 * Thin RSC wrapper around the (client) Insights overview page.
 *
 * The Insights root fans out into ~6 mount queries after hydrate; the highest-
 * value, cheapest, and safest to lift onto the server is the dashboard snapshot
 * — the SAME `queryKeys.dashboardSnapshot(locale)` cell the dashboard warms
 * (the hero's Tension Verdict + return-to-baseline ride it). Reading it through
 * the shared `caches.analytics` SWR cell during SSR and handing it to TanStack
 * via `HydrationBoundary` means an Insights visit no longer re-pays the snapshot
 * round-trip on the client, and the hero's snapshot-derived band paints from the
 * first HTML instead of after a client fetch.
 *
 * Contract notes (the v1.30.9 dashboard template):
 *  - THE CRUX — the snapshot cell is locale-keyed
 *    (`queryKeys.dashboardSnapshot(locale)`). The locale is resolved ONCE
 *    server-side by `readDashboardSnapshotCached` (via `resolveServerLocale`)
 *    and the client's `useDashboardSnapshot` keys on the SAME resolved locale
 *    from the i18n context — the identical mechanism the dashboard already
 *    relies on, so the server-seeded key equals the client key by construction.
 *  - The dehydrated VALUE is JSON-round-tripped so the hydrated shape is exactly
 *    what the client `queryFn` produces from the wire (ISO date strings), never
 *    a Date-carrying sibling that poisons the cell.
 *  - The client snapshot cell reads `refetchOnMount: false`, so the seeded
 *    fresh value lands and is used without an immediate refetch.
 *  - The `["user","dashboardWidgets"]` layout the snapshot carries is seeded too
 *    (mirroring the client `queryFn`'s own seed), removing the widgets stage
 *    from the chart-overlay-prefs waterfall exactly as on the dashboard.
 *  - Left CLIENT-LAZY on purpose: the AI daily briefing (`GET /api/insights/
 *    generate`) — prefetching it must never trigger provider generation
 *    (generation stays cron + explicit-button only), so it keeps its own lazy
 *    read; and the heavy thick-analytics / comprehensive aggregations, whose
 *    COLD SWR cell is a multi-query scan — prefetching them synchronously would
 *    trade FCP for TTFB. Both stay on the client cells that own them.
 *  - Fail-soft: no session or a builder hiccup renders the page exactly as
 *    before this wrapper existed — the client cells own the fetch.
