/**
 * v1.4.27 MB7 / CF-52 — shared `<select>` primitive.
 *
 * Three settings/admin surfaces (`AccountSection`, `TimezonePicker`,
 * `GeneralSettingsSection`) each declared a local `NATIVE_SELECT_CLASS`
 * constant that traced the same visual contract as the shadcn
 * `<SelectTrigger>` (border + bg + ring tokens, focus vocabulary).
 * The three copies had drifted slightly — one dropped `w-full`,
 * another dropped the `shadow-xs` token — so the three forms rendered
 * at subtly different weights despite reading "the same select" to
 * the user.
 *
 * The primitive collapses the duplicates. Consumers wrap it like a
 * raw `<select>` and the className still composes via `cn(...)` so
 * site-specific tweaks (`sm:max-w-sm`, etc.) keep working.
 *
 * Height: `h-10` (40 px) — matches the v1.4.27 tap-target floor on
 * `<Input>` and `<SelectTrigger>` (MB2). The legacy `h-9` (36 px)
 * the three call sites carried was the pre-v1.4.27 contract; the
 * primitive extraction lands at the new floor so every form input on
 * the same row reads at the same height.
 *
 * Why native? The shadcn `<Select>` from `@radix-ui/react-select` is
 * the better keyboard experience on desktop but pulls in extra
 * client JS and does not show the iOS / Android native picker.
 * Settings/admin surfaces benefit from the native picker (especially
 * for the 400-entry timezone list) so we deliberately stay on
 * `<select>` here. The styled primitive keeps the visual rhythm
 * uniform with the rest of the form's `<Input>` + `<SelectTrigger>`
 * rows.

// v1.4.34 IW-G — floor at 44 px on mobile to clear WCAG 2.5.5; shrink
// to 40 px on sm+ where the pointer precision is higher.
//
// Chevron symmetry: `appearance-none` drops the browser-drawn dropdown arrow,
// whose right inset is OS-controlled and reads visibly farther from the edge
// than the value text sits from the left. We paint our own chevron as a
// background SVG positioned `right 0.75rem center` (12 px) so its inset mirrors
// the left text padding (`px-3`) — matching the shadcn `<SelectTrigger>`.
// Doing it as a background (rather than an overlay element) keeps `<select>` a
// single element, so every call site's width / margin className still composes
// straight onto it. `pe-9` reserves room so a long value never runs under the
// chevron. The chevron glyph is the same path Lucide's `ChevronDownIcon` draws.
// Colour: `currentColor` inside a background-image data URI resolves to black
// (no CSS cascade reaches it), which read as a near-black arrow on the light
// theme. The stroke is therefore baked per theme into the
// `--native-select-chevron` custom property in `globals.css`, pinned to the
// theme's `--muted-foreground` — same colour the shadcn `<SelectTrigger>`
// chevron uses.
