/**
 * v1.21.0 — discreet "Learn more" pointer to a public /learn guide.
 *
 * One small, calm anchor (no new colour, no card chrome) that links a concept
 * out to its plain-language guide. Fail-closed by construction:
 *
 *   - the href is resolved through `learnLinkForMetric` — a closed-set,
 *     registry-backed URL, never user/model content — so there is no XSS
 *     surface and no invented link;
 *   - an unmapped concept resolves to `null` and the component renders
 *     nothing, so a surface that wires a concept with no guide simply shows
 *     no pointer rather than a broken one.
 *
 * It is a literal `<a>` (no markdown library): `target="_blank"` with
 * `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, the guide title as the accessible label.

/**
 * v1.22 (W5) — inline, catalog-whitelisted Learn anchor for AI prose.
 *
 * Where `LearnMoreLink` resolves a *concept* to its guide for a deterministic
 * UI surface, this variant linkifies a `/learn/<slug>` reference that already
 * appears in trusted prose (the Coach reply, post-filtered server-side by
 * `scrubUnknownLearnLinks`). The slug is resolved through `learnUrl` — the same
 * closed-set, registry-backed builder — so an unknown slug renders the children
 * as plain text (fail-closed): a drifted post-filter can never produce a
 * clickable invented href, and there is no markdown / HTML parsing involved.
 *
 * The visible label is the caller's `children` (the original URL text), keeping
 * the reference verbatim; the safe attributes (`target="_blank"`,
 * `rel="noopener noreferrer"`) mirror `LearnMoreLink`.
