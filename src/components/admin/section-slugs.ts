/**
 * Server-safe constants for the v1.5 admin split. Mirrors the pattern in

 * (`generateStaticParams()`, the page guard, route-existence tests) can
 * import the slug list without dragging the `<AdminShell>` client bundle
 * into the server graph.
 *
 * Order is the in-app navigation order — sidebar nav, mobile strip, and
 * `generateStaticParams()` all consume it directly.
