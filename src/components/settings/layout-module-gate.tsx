/**
 * v1.25.11 (#148) — client gate for an Appearance subpage
 * (`/settings/layout/<module>`).
 *
 * A module's subpage may be reached by direct URL even when the user has the
 * module turned off. This wrapper fails OPEN: it renders the section unless the
 * resolved `useAuth().user.modules` map has the gate key explicitly `false`,
 * in which case it bounces back to the hub (`/settings/layout`).
 *
 * The gate is hydration-stable: `useMounted()` returns `false` during SSR AND
 * the first client paint, so the first render ALWAYS shows the section
 * (matching the server HTML); the real check applies once, after hydration, as
 * an ordinary client update. The redirect is a client-only effect, so it never
 * diverges the initial render and cannot trigger a React #418 mismatch.
 *
 * Groups with no `moduleGate` (dashboard / insights / vorsorge) pass
 * `moduleGate={undefined}` and always render.
