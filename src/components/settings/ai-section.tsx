/**
 * Settings → AI section wrapper.
 *
 * v1.16.4 — the former 2k-LOC monolith is split into per-provider
 * subcomponents under `src/components/settings/ai/` (one file per
 * provider form, plus the chain / runtime cards). This file only owns
 * the section frame and the card order; behaviour lives in the parts.
 *
 * v1.18.0 (S5) — the Coach preference cards (disable toggle, preferences,
 * memory) moved out to the dedicated Coach section. The AI section keeps
 * only provider / model / BYOK configuration.
 *
 * v1.18.1 (D8) — the "About me" context moved to Settings → Account (under
 * Profil, before Zyklus-Tracking). It is personal medical context the daily
 * briefing reads too, so it belongs with the account profile rather than the
 * provider-configuration screen.
