/**
 * v1.25 (W-RECORDS) — Settings → Anamnese (medical history).
 *
 * The home for the structured health records: allergies / intolerances and
 * family history. Each is a self-contained CRUD manager rendered in its own
 * card. These are patient-reported reference records — not a time-series
 * signal and not a clinical diagnosis — surfaced alongside the existing
 * tracking-domain settings sections (Labs / Illness / Vorsorge).
 *
 * v1.25.12 — the section is the single home for the pre-existing / chronic
 * conditions the Coach watches, edited inline here so conditions + allergies +
 * family history read (and write) as one coherent medical history. The
 * conditions card is coach-gated (the data only feeds the Coach); it reads and
 * writes the same self-context store (`/api/coach/about-me`) the rest of the app
 * uses — the placement simply moved out of personal context into the medical
 * record where it belongs.
