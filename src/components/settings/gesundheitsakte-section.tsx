/**
 * v1.18.0 (S5) — Settings → Gesundheitsakte (health record).
 *
 * The full health-record export is a distinct concept — a complete,
 * clinician-ready record (PDF + FHIR R4 + a combined zip package) — and earns
 * its own top-level settings home rather than sharing the page with the
 * generic CSV / JSON data-out paths.
 *
 * The `doctorReport` module governs the data layer, not the Settings
 * entry-point: as of v1.18.6.1 the nav entry always shows (the health record
 * is a flagship export capability and should never silently vanish from
 * Settings). The server-side `/api/export/health-record` route is the hard
 * enforcement — it refuses with a 403 `module.disabled` envelope when the
 * account has opted out, so a disabled doctor-report surface cannot be
 * reached over a Bearer token either.
 *
 * v1.25.7 — the clinician share-link surface (formerly the standalone
 * "Freigabe" section) folds in here as a labelled "Sharing" group below the
 * export panel: a time-boxed read-only link is a sharing face of the SAME
 * health record. `/settings/sharing` 301-redirects to
 * `/settings/gesundheitsakte#sharing`. The backing model, the
 * `/api/share-links` routes, and the public `/c/[token]` view are unchanged.
