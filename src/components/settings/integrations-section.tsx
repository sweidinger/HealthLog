/**
 * `<IntegrationsSection>` — Settings → Integrationen.
 *
 * v1.18.1 (D4) — the Connections content IS the Integrationen page: clicking
 * Integrationen shows the OAuth + device data sources (Withings / WHOOP /
 * Fitbit / Polar / Oura / Nightscout) directly, with no tab strip.
 *
 * v1.25.7 — the delivery CHANNELS (Telegram / ntfy / Web Push / Webhook /
 * Email) move back here from Notifications as a labelled "Delivery channels"
 * group below the connections. Channels are delivery providers — the same
 * conceptual family as Withings / WHOOP / a connected device — not reminder
 * preferences, so they belong with the other integrations. Notifications keeps
 * only the reminder-TYPE content. The group carries `id="channels"` so
 * `/settings/channels` 301-redirects to `/settings/integrations#channels`, and
 * the per-channel anchors (`#telegram`, `#ntfy`, …) inside the panel keep
 * working.
 *
 * `parseOAuthOutcome` / `oauthReasonKey` are re-exported from
 * `connections-panel.tsx` so existing unit-test imports keep resolving.
 *
 * 2026-07-17 UX/IA audit M7 — `<NutrientIntakeCard>` (v1.28) moved here from
 * Settings → Sources. It is a read-only sync inventory (what the Apple
 * Health nutrients opt-in has stored), not a which-connection-wins ranking —
 * "Source priority" describes the latter only. Matches the standing
 * providers→Integrations rule; the card still renders nothing while the
 * `nutrients` module is off.
