/**
 * v1.18.0 (S5) — Settings → Coach.
 *
 * The Coach preference cards moved out of the AI / Assistant section into
 * their own dedicated entry so the AI section owns only provider / model /
 * BYOK configuration. This section gathers the Coach-specific surface:
 *
 *   1. Disable Coach    — the per-user opt-out (kept first so a user who
 *                         wants the surface gone finds it immediately).
 *   2. Coach preferences — tone, verbosity, data scope (`useCoachPrefs`).
 *   3. Proactive nudge   — the daily-nudge opt-out + per-group frequency
 *                          (moved here from Settings → Benachrichtigungen in
 *                          v1.18.6: it is a Coach setting, not a generic
 *                          notification).
 *   4. Coach memory      — durable-fact review + forget controls.
 *
 * The nav entry is module-gated on `coach`. The preference + nudge + memory
 * cards keep their own content gate on `!user.disableCoach` (mirrored from the
 * old AI section): hiding the Coach hides its tuning + memory controls too.
 *
 * The "about me" context lives in the AI section, not here — the daily
 * briefing reads it too, so it is not a Coach-only setting.
 *
 * v1.18.6 (W9) — the visible heading + subtitle now come from the shared
 * `<SettingsSectionFrame>` in the route; this body is the Coach cards only.
