/**
 * The web withdrawal affordance. Before this card the revoke endpoint was
 * reachable only from the native client, so a web-only account could give
 * AI consent and never take it back.
 *
 * These render the card against a pre-seeded query cache (server-side
 * markup, so the mutation path is not exercised here — the endpoint it
 * calls has its own route tests). What they pin is that the card reports
 * the standing decision correctly and offers the withdrawal only when
 * there is something to withdraw.
