/**
 * v1.18.1 — the cycle log-sheet field-explainer affordance.
 *
 * A small "?" / info icon that puts a factual, descriptive-only one-liner
 * (what a clinical field means — BBT, cervical mucus, an LH surge) right at
 * the point of capture, so a first-time user never has to leave the sheet to
 * understand a term.
 *
 * L2 (`.planning/audits/2026-07-18-qa-ui.md`) — this used to be a
 * self-contained hover `Tooltip`, which never opens reliably on tap; the
 * cycle sheet is a thumb-first surface, so it now wraps the click-opened
 * `InfoPopover` (the app's one (i) info-affordance since the v1.28.17
 * merge) instead, keeping the `cycle-field-info` data-slot the sheet
 * already keys off of.
 *
 * Copy stays descriptive-only — never diagnosis or medical advice — matching
 * the phase-education honesty gate.
