/**
 * The ONE async boundary for every recharts-rendering component.
 *
 * Every `next/dynamic` chart import in the tree points at THIS module
 * (`import("@/components/charts/chart-runtime")`), never at the individual
 * chart files. Pointing N dynamic boundaries at N different modules made
 * Turbopack emit a separate chunk group per boundary, each carrying its own
 * full copy of the recharts module graph — the production build shipped
 * EIGHT ~312 KB copies of the library, and /insights alone downloaded two
 * (~92 KB gz of pure duplication on the worst-LCP route). One shared import
 * target ⇒ one shared chunk group ⇒ recharts exists exactly once, cached
 * across every route.
 *
 * Extends the v1.16.7 `mood-charts.ts` precedent (which did this for the
 * mood trio) to the whole chart surface; that scoped barrel is folded in
 * here.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - A new recharts consumer is added HERE and loaded through
 *    `dynamic(() => import("@/components/charts/chart-runtime").then(...))`
 *    at its call site — with the call site's own matching skeleton.
 *  - No component outside this module's static import graph may import
 *    "recharts" directly.
 *  - Types stay importable from the component files directly (type-only
 *    imports are value-free and don't drag the chunk in).
