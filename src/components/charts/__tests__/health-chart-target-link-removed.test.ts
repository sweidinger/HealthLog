 * v1.16.8 — the in-header "adjust targets" link is gone from the chart
 * card. The affordance duplicated the page-level target-adjust control
 * in the insights sub-page header (`<TargetAdjustButton>`); the chart
 * stays a read surface. Pinned at the source level (same convention as
 * the auth-shell hoist contract) so the link doesn't quietly return on
 * a future header rework.
