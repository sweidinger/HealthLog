/**
 * Phase A5 / B-mobile finding (CRITICAL #1): Recharts wraps every
 * chart in a `<ResponsiveContainer>` whose default
 * `touch-action: auto` makes the browser wait for the chart's JS
 * touchmove handler before starting page scroll. On slow devices that
 * causes the maintainer's "Scrolling-Hänger im Dashboard auf Charts".
 *
 * Fix: every chart's wrapper `<div>` (the one that contains the
 * `<ResponsiveContainer>`) must carry the Tailwind `touch-pan-y`
 * utility so the browser starts vertical scroll immediately without
 * waiting for the JS handler.
 *
 * This test is a textual guard: if a future refactor accidentally
 * drops `touch-pan-y` from any chart wrapper, the unit test catches
 * it before it ships. The simpler textual check (vs. rendering each
 * chart) avoids the heavy Recharts + TanStack-Query + Auth provider
 * scaffold every individual chart needs to render.
