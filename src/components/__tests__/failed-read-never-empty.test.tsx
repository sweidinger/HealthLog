/**
 * A failed read must never render as an absence of data.
 *
 * "No data yet" is a factual claim about the user's record. Making it when the
 * read failed is a false statement about their health history — worst of all on
 * the mental-wellbeing surface, where a user with months of screening results
 * was told, in a mental-health context, that they had never taken an
 * assessment.
 *
 * Each surface must tell three states apart: loading, failed, and genuinely
 * empty. These tests pin the failed/empty split; the loading branch is asserted
 * where it is SSR-observable.
 *
 * SSR-only convention (`renderToStaticMarkup`, no `@testing-library/react`), so
 * the error state is produced by seeding the query cache with a settled failure
 * rather than by driving a real fetch.
