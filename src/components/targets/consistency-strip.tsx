/**
 * v1.4.25 W3e — 7-day consistency strip.
 *
 * Renders one dot per Berlin-tz day in `days` (oldest → newest, index 6
 * is today). Each dot's appearance encodes both whether the day was
 * logged and whether the day's mean reading landed in the target's
 * green band:
 *
 *   • Solid green   — `"in"`   : day's mean was in the target band
 *   • Solid amber   — `"near"` : day's mean was in the orange band
 *   • Solid red     — `"out"`  : day's mean was outside both bands
 *   • Hollow ring   — `null`   : day had no readings (dim border only)
 *
 * Cap to the right: "5 of 7 in range" (or the user's locale's
 * equivalent). The cap reads off `daysInRange` and `daysLogged`. When
 * the cap would be misleading on thin data (≤ 2 days logged) we surface
 * "X of 7 logged" instead so the user sees the cadence problem, not the
 * misleading range count.
 *
 * Hidden by the parent when the target's `insufficientData` flag is
 * true — there is no "— not enough data" empty-state mode here; the
 * card surfaces that copy in a different slot per the maintainer's "no empty hint
 * inside the strip" directive.
 *
 * Visual rationale (frontend-design skill): seven dots over the v1.4.22
 * 24-px sparkline trades a continuous-but-distorted signal for seven
 * honest atomic answers. The hollow-ring "no data" state means the
 * gap is visible without leaving the user wondering whether the
 * sparkline simply ended there.
