 * Shared chrome for the data-management lists (measurements + mood).

 * v1.15.13 — the `SortableHead` + single-row `DeleteButton` were copy-
 * pasted between `measurement-list.tsx` and `mood-list.tsx`; they now
 * live here once, alongside the new page-scoped multi-select selection
 * bar and its pure selection math. Each list keeps its own columns +
 * formatting; only the shared chrome lives in this module.
