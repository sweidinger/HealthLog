 *
 * Renders the server-computed `rangeStatus` as a calm, informative marker.
 * The project's no-alarming-colour ethos is a hard rule here: an
 * out-of-range value is NOT painted red. It reads as a neutral `secondary`
 * badge with a quiet direction arrow (↓ below / ↑ above), exactly the same
 * weight as the in-range and unknown states. The number leaving the
 * reference window is information a clinician scans — not an alarm to the
 * user, who may be perfectly aware of (and managing) the value.
 *
 * `unknown` (the lab reported no usable bounds) renders nothing — there is
 * no verdict to show, and an empty badge would be noise.
