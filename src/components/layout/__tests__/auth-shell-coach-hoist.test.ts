/**
 * v1.4.34 IW-B — auth-shell hoist contract.
 *
 * The Coach launch provider used to live on `app/insights/layout.tsx`,
 * which meant the drawer was only reachable from `/insights/**`. The
 * hoist moves the provider + the drawer mount to `<AuthShell>` so every
 * authenticated route (dashboard included) shares the same context and
 * can call `askCoach()` from any descendant.
 *
 * Project convention keeps this contract pinned at the source level
 * because `<AuthShell>` is hard to render under SSR (it reads
 * `useAuth()` + `usePathname()` + the router) and we don't want a fully
 * mocked `@testing-library/react` setup for a one-line invariant.
