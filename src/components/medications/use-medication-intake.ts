/**

 * dashboard snapshot AND the Today digest, both inactive while the user is on
 * the medication card or detail page, are marked stale but never refetched. On
 * navigating back each remounts under `refetchOnMount: false`, so the pre-write
 * cache is served and the "due" prompt (snapshot dose tally) plus the digest's
 * dose-window rail item both linger until a hard reload. Force the inactive
 * queries to refetch so the dashboard clears as soon as the dose is recorded.
 *
 * v1.29.1 — the digest joins the forced-inactive refetch. Its `medsToday`
 * reads the SAME server snapshot cell the intake route already hard-evicts, so
 * the refetch returns post-write dose state immediately (no server change
 * needed — the eviction seam is reused).
