/**
 * v1.16.11 (#316) — "take all due at once": the due-set derivation plus
 * the confirm-time orchestration behind the medications-page header
 * button. A user with several medications due in the current window
 * confirms them in ONE action instead of per-card taps.
 *
 * Due-set derivation reuses the EXACT pipeline a single card runs —
 * `reduceCurrentWindowStatus` (band model + server display-due gate +
 * taken-early downgrade) and `resolveDisplayedSlotInstant` (the canonical
 * slot the card's own "Genommen" button would record) — so the set the
 * dialog lists is, by construction, the set of cards currently showing a
 * take-now / overdue pill. No new endpoint: every input rides on the
 * `GET /api/medications` list payload the page already holds.
 *
 * Recording loops the per-medication `POST /api/medications/{id}/intake`
 * (the same call `runRecordIntake` makes for one card) rather than the
 * `POST /api/medications/intake/bulk` endpoint, deliberately:
 *
 *   - The bulk route is the iOS SyncMode surface: its taken path requires
 *     an explicit `takenAt` and attributes by band membership
 *     (`resolveSlotForWriteByBand`) or a `forceSlotInstant` user pin. The
 *     interactive card semantics instead send the DISPLAYED slot as
 *     `scheduledFor` and let the server stamp `takenAt = now` — for an
 *     overdue slot whose catch-up tail extends past the band, the two
 *     attributions can diverge. Looping the single route keeps slot
 *     attribution, inventory consumption (`consumedTransition` gate) and
 *     the canonical-slot upsert idempotency byte-identical to N
 *     individual taps.
 *   - Per-medication failure isolation falls out naturally: each POST
 *     succeeds or fails alone, the summary toast reports both counts, and
 *     the failed medications simply stay due (the invalidation refetch
 *     re-derives them into the set).
 *
 * The due set is small (a handful of medications, never the 500-entry
 * sync scale), so N sequential round trips are negligible.
