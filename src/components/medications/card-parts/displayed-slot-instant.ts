/**
 * v1.12.3 — resolve the canonical slot instant of the dose a medication
 * card is currently surfacing, so the card's "Genommen" / "Skip" buttons
 * record THAT dose rather than letting the server snap "now" to the
 * nearest slot.
 *
 * Background: the medication cards show a single actionable dose — either
 * the current/overdue window (when `currentWindowStatus` resolves to
 * in_window / late / very_late) or the next-due dose (`nextDueAt`). The
 * intake POST historically carried `{ skipped }` only, so the server
 * defaulted `scheduledFor` to `now()` and snapped to whichever slot was
 * nearest. For a twice-daily 07:00 / 19:00 medication a morning tap (before
 * the 13:00 midpoint) therefore marked the 07:00 dose even when the user
 * meant a different slot, and a non-deliberate morning tap mis-recorded the
 * morning dose. Threading the displayed dose's slot instant onto the POST
 * lets the server resolve the exact dose the user is looking at,
 * deterministically and independently of the wall-clock.
 *
 * The returned instant is fed to the intake route's `scheduledFor`, which
 * runs it through `resolveSlotInstantForWrite` (the canonical ±tolerance
 * snap). It only needs to fall inside the target slot's capture zone, so a
 * sub-minute DST-offset slop is harmless — the snap collapses it onto the
 * exact canonical slot row.
