/**
 * v1.4.28 FB-G1 — shared medication-list row header.
 *
 * The generic `<MedicationCard>` and the `<Glp1MedicationCard>` carry
 * the same two-line row shape on the medications list page. Both rows
 * route their title + dose + drug class through this primitive so the
 * surface stays one consistent shape:
 *
 *   Line 1: `{name}` — bold, `text-lg`
 *   Line 2: `{dose}` outline badge (only when non-empty) + `{categoryLabel}`
 *           outline badge, side by side — `[7,5 mg] [Sonstiges]`
 *   Line 3: optional state badges (own row, below)
 *
 * The trailing `actions` slot carries the overflow kebab on the right of
 * the row. State badges (without-notification, paused-since, inactive)
 * ride on line 2 alongside the class label so a narrow viewport keeps a
 * single inline run.
 *
 * v1.7.2 W3 — when `href` is set the name + dose + category region
 * becomes a Link to the medication detail page (the former chevron
 * target). The kebab in `actions` is a sibling outside the Link so
 * opening the menu never also navigates.
 *
 * The GLP-1 row previously surfaced a `<Syringe>` glyph + middle-dot
 * separator on line 1 and demoted the dose to a muted inline span. This
 * primitive folds it into the canonical two-line shape; the syringe icon
 * and the dot separator are gone from the list row.
