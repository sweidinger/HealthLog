/**
 * v1.28.52 (Documents R3) — "Ask the Coach" opens the REAL fenced coach
 * conversation in the shared SIDE DRAWER, scoped to the document, instead of a
 * full-page nav to `/coach?doc=<id>` (the v1.28.51 behaviour Marc corrected).
 *
 * The wiring is source-structural (the send-path fence itself is covered by the
 * coach-send-target unit tests — untouched here). These guards pin:
 *   1. the detail sheet drives the drawer via `askCoach(..., doc.id)`, closing
 *      the sheet first, and no longer navigates to `/coach?doc=`;
 *   2. the launch context → mount → drawer → conversation `documentId` thread
 *      stays connected end-to-end.
