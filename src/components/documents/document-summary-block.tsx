/**
 * The document detail sheet's summary block, lifted out of the sheet so its
 * state machine renders without the dialog portal and is pinned by static-render
 * tests.
 *
 * The block exists because a null summary is ambiguous and used to be read as
 * one thing: "being generated". It was the fallback for every outcome — a
 * document nobody ever enqueued (no backfill reaches uploads that predate the
 * auto-read opt-in), a missing vision provider, a spent budget, a withdrawn
 * consent, an unreadable file, a provider error, and a summary the outbound
 * safety screen withheld. All of them left the column null, so the view told the
 * user a job was running that in most cases never existed.
 *
 * It now branches on the stored `summaryState`:
 *
 *   READY       → the stored summary, served from storage, never regenerated
 *   PENDING     → "being generated" — the ONLY state allowed to claim that, and
 *                 it is set when a job was actually enqueued
 *   WITHHELD    → says the summary was blocked, offers another attempt. The
 *                 blocked prose is never shown or stored
 *   UNAVAILABLE → says none could be produced, offers another attempt
 *   NONE        → says none exists yet, offers to generate one
 *
 * The action is a click, never an effect: opening a document must not spend a
 * provider call. With no AI provider configured the block renders the state
 * without an action rather than an button that would 422.
