/**
 * S2 — the Today hero, the promoted day's read on the dashboard.
 *
 * MARC SIGN-OFF (2026-07-16, decision 1): Today is the dashboard hero
 * promoted to the default read, with the dense tile grid demoted below
 * it on the SAME page — no new nav destination. This band mounts above
 * the existing tile strip and renders the S1 `DailyDigest` DTO verbatim;
 * it recomputes nothing (server-authoritative parity) and fetches no
 * fresh AI (the caller's hook GETs the already-cached digest route).
 *
 * Composition (plan §2.1, top→bottom, all shipped primitives):
 *   - the day's read: the health `ScoreRing` (`flat`, md) with its
 *     server-computed band and an honest provisional/final face — a null
 *     score paints the ring's own provisional state, never a zero;
 *   - v1.29.1 (Marc, live-use): the v1.29.0 selected-score-ring cluster is
 *     removed from the web hero — it read as uneven and wasted tile space.
 *     The health `ScoreRing` is the hero's only ring now. The score-ring
 *     SELECTION contract stays server-side (`selectedScoreRings` on the
 *     snapshot still feeds iOS); the web hero simply stops rendering it;
 *   - the briefing lead in plain language (via `ProseBlocks`, no markdown)
 *     with a "read the full briefing" affordance, plus the top signal's
 *     present-tense headline + delta when the digest carries one;
 *   - the freshness note: when `sleepPending`, a calm muted "last night's
 *     sleep not yet in" line — it never blocks the hero (plan §2.4);
 *   - the worth-a-look rail: the digest's `PriorityItem[]` as `PriorityCard`s
 *     (S1's one rail primitive), only when non-empty. When the digest is
 *     all-clear, a first-class muted "nothing needs your attention" line
 *     stands in its place — not an alarming empty card.
 *
 * Every `PriorityItem` action carries an `href` (dose.log → /medications,
 * sync.reconnect → /settings/integrations, checkup.view → /checkups), so
 * `PriorityCard` wires each tap as a `<Link>` to its existing destination
 * by construction; S2 invents no new backend action.
