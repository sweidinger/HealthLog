/**
 * v1.31.0 — the derived-score sheets' outbound edge.
 *
 * The score sheets were the one assessment surface with NO way out: they
 * mounted the same `<InsightStatusCard>` every metric page uses but passed
 * neither an opener nor a scope, so the card painted no action at all and the
 * sheet read one-way.
 *
 * A composite has no snapshot block of its own, so each sheet must hand off
 * narrowed to the INPUTS that drive it — a scope of `undefined` would open the
 * default all-source snapshot and lose the context the sheet is about.
 *
 * The status card is stubbed to a probe recording its props: assert the
 * resolved hand-off, never rendered text (responsive classes have broken
 * text-based queries in this repo).
