 * Each sub-page renders:

 *   - the canonical chart for the metric (passed in as `chart` so the
 *     page can wire the right `chartKey`, target zones, value bands, …),
 *   - secondary slot for related cards (correlation cards, per-medication
 *     lists, …).
 *
 * The shell handles focus restoration on route change — a screen-reader
 * user landing here from a tab click hears the page heading
 * automatically because we mount an `id="insights-subpage-title"`
 * h1 with `tabIndex={-1}` and focus it on mount. Sighted users get a
 * `scrollTo({ top: 0 })` so deep-scroll position from the previous
 * sub-page doesn't leak in.
