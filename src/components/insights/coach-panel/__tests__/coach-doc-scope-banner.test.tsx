/**
 * v1.29.x (S7) — the fenced-conversation banner.
 *
 * When the Coach is fenced — here seeded via the `/coach?doc=<id>` hand-off,
 * which stages ONE document as a pending first-turn attachment before any
 * thread exists — the shared `<CoachConversation>` surface paints the
 * `coach-doc-scope` banner: a paperclip + "N documents attached" count and the
 * honest fencing line (the coach runs WITHOUT access to health data and reads
 * only the attached documents). While a staged attachment is still being
 * content-indexed the banner adds the "still being indexed" hint. On a normal
 * health thread the banner is absent. The fenced-send routing guarantee itself
 * is pinned by `coach-send-target.test.ts`.
 *
 * `pendingAttachmentIds` seeds from the `initialDocumentId` prop via a
 * `useState` initializer, so the banner resolves in a single static-markup
 * pass. The document detail (`/api/documents/inbound/<id>`) is seeded into the
 * cache so the staged pill's title + indexed status render without a network
 * call.
