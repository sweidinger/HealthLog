/**
 * v1.18.9 — Claude-style word-by-word fade-in for the LIVE Coach turn.
 *
 * The provider clients return the whole reply in one shot; the chat route
 * re-chunks it into per-word `token` SSE frames (`tokeniseForStreaming`),
 * so `content` grows as frames land. While the turn is streaming each
 * whitespace segment of the GROWING tail renders as its own `<span>` that
 * fades + drifts up on mount, giving the reply a "thinking out loud"
 * cadence rather than a hard dump of word groups.
 *
 * v1.22 (W5) — paragraph-aware + SSE-safe. The reply now renders as real
 * `<p>` blocks (shared `ProseBlocks`), so a model that emits blank-line
 * paragraph breaks reads as paragraphs, not one run-on block — consistent
 * with the daily briefing + insight cards. Under streaming, every COMPLETE
 * paragraph settles immediately (plain text, with the safe Learn linkifier)
 * and only the LAST, still-growing paragraph animates word-by-word. When a
 * fresh `\n\n` arrives the tail becomes a completed paragraph and stops
 * animating; the already-settled paragraphs keep their index keys and never
 * replay. Once the whole turn settles (`streaming === false`) it collapses
 * to the same `ProseBlocks` render the persisted history uses.
 *
 * Why no "only animate the new words" bookkeeping: each tail segment is
 * keyed by its index, so when a fresh SSE frame appends words React keeps
 * the already-mounted spans (their CSS entrance already ran and does not
 * replay on reconcile) and only MOUNTS the new trailing spans — which is
 * exactly when the `animate-in` entrance fires. The browser does the
 * "new words only" gating for us; no render-time ref is needed.
 *
 * CSP-safe: the entrance is Tailwind's `animate-in fade-in-0
 * slide-in-from-bottom-1` (compiled utilities served from `'self'`) plus a
 * per-span inline `animationDelay` / `animationDuration`. Inline `style`
 * attributes are already permitted under the strict CSP
 * (`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`); there is no runtime-injected
 * `<style>` tag, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and no markdown library —
 * the text renders as plain React children (with a closed-set Learn
 * linkifier), the XSS-safe path the rest of the Coach uses.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`: the animation classes are `motion-safe:`
 * gated, so reduced-motion users get the words instantly with no fade and
 * no translate.
