/**
 * v1.21.2 (A2 + A3) — the Coach's visible scope/opener affordance.
 *
 * Two modes, one surface:
 *
 *  - **scope** (A2): the Coach was launched narrowed to a metric (from a
 *    metric page or an insight card). Instead of the old hidden composer
 *    prefill, render a small pill — "The Coach is already on <metric>" —
 *    plus a tappable seed question that drops the data-aware opener into
 *    the composer / sends it. This turns the built-but-invisible scope
 *    plumbing into the core ambient feeling.
 *
 *  - **seeded** (A3): the Coach opened UNSCOPED (the blank hero) and the
 *    server surfaced today's single most notable derived signal. Render it
 *    as a tappable suggested opener so the blank box is never cold. When no
 *    signal crosses the gate the caller renders nothing and the neutral
 *    greeting stands — there is no fake opener.
 *
 * Presentational + self-contained: the parent supplies the resolved label
 * and the seed question, and an `onSeed` callback wired to the composer.
 * The badge owns no data fetching.
