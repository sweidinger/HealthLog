/**
 * v1.18.9 — the Coach new-chat hero (page surface only).
 *
 * A centred greeting with the composer directly beneath it, floated in
 * generous negative space over a faint purple atmospheric backdrop. This
 * replaces the cramped bottom-pinned empty thread with a calm,
 * ChatGPT/Claude-grade prompt surface. On first send the conversation
 * branch takes over and the composer docks to the bottom (handled by
 * `<CoachConversation>`).
 *
 * The hero does NOT fork composer logic: it RECEIVES the live
 * `<CoachInput>` as the `composer` slot, so dictation, auto-grow, the
 * send/stop control, and the guided-question placeholder all behave
 * exactly as in the docked composer.
 *
 * v1.18.10 (W4) — the starter-question suggestion chips below the composer
 * are removed (maintainer feedback): the hero is greeting + composer only,
 * matching the reference ChatGPT/Claude new-chat surface.
 *
 * Motion: one orchestrated reveal — sparkle → greeting → composer stagger
 * in via `motion-safe` `animate-in` with capped delays; reduced-motion
 * users get the layout instantly.
 *
 * v1.22.0 (A2 + A3) — the hero accepts an optional `scopeHint` slot
 * (a `<ScopeHintBadge>`): the visible "the Coach is already on <metric>"
 * pill + seed question when launched scoped (A2), or the pre-seeded
 * notable-signal opener when launched unscoped (A3). When absent the hero
 * is the calm greeting + composer exactly as before, so the neutral
 * blank-state fallback is structural.
