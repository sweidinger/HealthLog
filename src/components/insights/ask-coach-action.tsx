/**
 * v1.21.0 (C4 H2) — discreet "Ask the Coach about this" affordance for
 * high-value insight / assessment cards (briefing, recommendation,
 * correlation, status, health-score, period narrative).
 *
 * It is the reverse-direction entry point the C4 audit flagged as
 * missing: the cards carry the richest context in the app, so a single
 * small action per card opens the Coach pre-scoped to that card's topic
 * with a seeded opener. Reuses the existing launch context — no parallel
 * launch system.
 *
 * Subtle by construction: a ghost, muted-foreground text+icon button (no
 * alarming colour, no card-tinting — the medication-card rule holds). One
 * entry point per card, never a cluster.
 *
 * Self-gates on the same triple the FAB / inline pill use (provider
 * mounted + operator flag + per-user opt-out) so a card never paints a
 * dead Coach control.
