 * Lives on the right side of the `<HeroStrip>` band on `lg+` viewports
 * and stacks below the title block on `<lg`. Surfaces:
 *   - the composite 0..100 score with a band-coloured number
 *   - "vs last week" delta line with arrow + percentage
 *   - 4 component rows (BP / Weight / Mood / Compliance) with sub-bars
 *   - "Indicative — not a clinical assessment" disclaimer
 *   - "Ask the Coach" button that opens the B2 drawer with a prefill
 *     ("Why is my health score X out of 100?") so the user can drill
 *     into the explanation without retyping the question
 *
 * v1.4.25 W8e — collapsible "Driven by" provenance accordion appended
 * below the component sub-bars. Each row shows the value bar, the
 * effective weight share, and a source pill so the user can see which
 * ingest path produced each pillar. A "mixed source" banner fires when
 * at least one component blends entries from more than one source.
 *
 * Pure presentational — the parent owns the analytics query + the
 * drawer state. The card mounts no inline Coach affordance; the hero
 * strip carries the single "Ask the coach" entry point.
