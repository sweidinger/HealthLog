/**
 * v1.12.7 — the single "What stands out" card.
 *
 * The mood page used to carry TWO separate "what stands out" surfaces: the
 * narrative takeaway feed up top, and the FDR-controlled discovered relations
 * lower down — both titled "What stands out", both taking a full card. This
 * folds them into ONE card: one `TileHeader`, the narrative one-liners, then
 * the discovered day-to-day relations as a labelled subsection. Each half
 * gates independently — the card renders whatever has content and degrades to
 * nothing when both are empty, so it never paints an empty shell.
 *
 * The discovered-relations fetch lives here (the correlation-discovery surface
 * is optional and self-degrades on a 403); the narrative items arrive from the
 * mood-insights aggregate the parent already holds.
