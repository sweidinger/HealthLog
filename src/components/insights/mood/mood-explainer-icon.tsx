 * v1.22 — the round info glyph that hid the statistical caveat behind a
 * hover/focus tooltip is gone. The maintainer wants the trailing "i"
 * affordance removed across the insights surface; the descriptive text it
 * used to gate now reads inline as a muted caption, so the explanation is
 * always visible rather than disclosure-only. The `label` prop is retained
 * for callers but is no longer rendered as an accessible trigger name —
 * there is no trigger to name.
