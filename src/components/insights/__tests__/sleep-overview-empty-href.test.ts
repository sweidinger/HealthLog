/**
 * The sleep-overview empty-state CTA must point at a REAL settings slug.
 * It previously linked to `/settings/devices`, which is not in
 * `SETTINGS_SECTION_SLUGS`, so the dynamic `[section]` route (dynamicParams
 * = false) calls `notFound()` → a hard 404 dead-end. This pins the href to
 * the `integrations` slug (where every device OAuth callback lands) and
 * guards against a regression to any non-existent slug.
