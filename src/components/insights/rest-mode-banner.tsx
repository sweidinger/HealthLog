/**
 * v1.18.1 — calm, neutral Rest Mode indicator.
 *
 * Rest Mode is the server-authoritative "an illness/condition episode is
 * active" context (`@/lib/illness/rest-mode`). When it is active the score,
 * recovery, and streak surfaces are FRAMED — never penalised — and iOS already
 * mirrors the annotation verbatim. The web surfaces (dashboard score card,
 * recovery insight) previously read the score with no on-screen explanation,
 * so a self-hoster saw their number behave differently with no cue. This
 * banner closes that web↔iOS parity gap.
 *
 * Contract (mirrors the audit's "value-free" requirement):
 *   - renders nothing when `annotation` is null or inactive (the common case);
 *   - never surfaces a decrypted note, an episode label, or any health value —
 *     the only data shown is the onset DATE (a calendar anchor, not a reading);
 *   - carries NO colour tint (a tinted "you're unwell" banner would alarm, not
 *     reassure) — it wears the same neutral bordered card the trend-annotation
 *     primitive uses so it reads as one of the calm insight surfaces.
 *
 * Pure presentational: the caller resolves `annotation` from the
 * server-authoritative score payload and passes it in.
