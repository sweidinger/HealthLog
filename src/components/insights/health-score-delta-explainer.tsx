/**
 * v1.4.28 R3c-Insights — explain the "vs last week" delta on tap.
 *
 * FB-I1: the user asked why the headline number moved. The earlier
 * delta line surfaced the digit ("-3 vs last week") without any
 * mention of which components shifted, what the comparison window
 * actually is, or what the user can do about it. The explainer is a
 * single icon-only `?` button next to the delta line that opens a
 * three-sentence read.
 *
 * Surface choice follows R1.1 §1 — popover on `md+`, bottom-sheet
 * on phone-class viewports. Both share the same body copy via the
 * `insights.healthScore.deltaExplainer.body` key; the title is
 * surfaced as the popover-content first line on desktop and as the
 * sheet header on mobile (the ResponsiveSheet primitive already
 * paints a header band on the sheet branch).
 *
 * Pure presentational. Owns its own open state — the parent doesn't
 * need to thread an extra prop through.
