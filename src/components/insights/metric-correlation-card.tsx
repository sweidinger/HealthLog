/**
 * v1.12.0 — per-metric correlation card.
 *
 * The canonical home for the one cross-metric relationship a metric
 * owns (the iOS canonical template relocates correlations off the
 * overview onto the owning metric page):
 *
 *   • Weight page  → weight × weekday
 *   • Pulse page   → mood × pulse
 *
 * It reads the already-computed `correlations` block off the thick
 * `/api/analytics` slice — the same payload the Insights overview warms.
 * On the common path (user lands on the overview first) this is a free
 * cache read; on direct metric-page entry it pays one thick fetch, the
 * same trade-off `<MetricTargetSummary>` already makes for the targets
 * payload.
 *
 * Self-suppressing: renders nothing while the payload is in-flight, when
 * the correlations feature is off, or when the owned hypothesis is below
 * the statistical surfacing bar (`status !== "ok"`). The single
 * `<CorrelationCard>` carries its own scatter + interpretation + source.
