/**
 * v1.21.0 (C4 H1/H4) — metric → Coach scope + seed-question map.
 *
 * The Coach launch context can now carry a live `scope` (a
 * `CoachScopeSource` + window) and a `prefill` seed question into the
 * conversation. This module is the single place that resolves "the user
 * is looking at metric X" into "open the Coach narrowed to source X with
 * a data-aware opener."
 *
 * Two callers consume it:
 *   - `<SubPageShell>` registers the active metric's scope as the page's
 *     ambient scope so the global FAB opens contextual to that page
 *     (no per-metric header icon — CCH-04 stays intact).
 *   - the "Ask the Coach" affordance on insight/assessment cards passes
 *     an explicit scope so a card tap lands a pre-scoped conversation.
 *
 * v1.22 (W6) — seed questions are i18n KEYS (`insights.coach.seed.*`), not
 * hardcoded English: a German user was getting an English composer seed. The
 * consumer (`SubPageShell`) resolves the key through `t()` before handing it to
 * the composer, so the seed reads in the user's language.

 * (mobility / gait micro-metrics with no dedicated snapshot block) simply
 * carry no ambient scope — the FAB opens the default snapshot, exactly as
 * before, so this is purely additive.
