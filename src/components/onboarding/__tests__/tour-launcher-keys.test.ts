/**
 * v1.4.15 H4 — sessionStorage keys used by the dashboard tour
 * launcher must be scoped per user id. Without scoping, an admin
 * impersonating a second user (or a family member sharing the
 * browser) inherited the first user's "tour dismissed for this
 * session" flag and the tour silently no-op'd for the second user.
 *
 * The key-builders are exported so this lock-test pins the wire
 * format. Changing them is a soft compatibility break — every
 * already-rendered tab would re-fire the tour for the user once,
 * because the un-prefixed legacy keys are never read again. We
 * accept that one-off tax in exchange for the multi-tenant
 * correctness.
 *
 * v1.18.6.1 — the tour is first-time-auto-start only; the former
 * `tourForceLaunchKey` replay-bypass key was removed along with every
 * in-app tour re-entry trigger.
