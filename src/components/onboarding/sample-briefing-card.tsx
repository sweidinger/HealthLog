/**
 * The onboarding "aha" artifact — a static, clearly-labelled *example*
 * daily briefing shown BEFORE any AI provider is connected.
 *
 * It exists so a fresh user feels the payoff of AI Insights with zero
 * setup: no provider is configured yet, so this makes no model call, no
 * fetch, no egress, and needs no consent. Every number is fixed copy
 * from the `onboarding.ai.sample*` keys (the worked example the
 * no-provider briefing empty state already carries) — it is never
 * derived from the user's own record, and the "Example" badge plus the
 * caption make that explicit so it is never mistaken for real data.
 *
 * Presentational only — no state, no effect, no data fetch. Reused by
 * the onboarding done-screen panel; safe to drop into any surface that
 * wants to show what a briefing reads like.
