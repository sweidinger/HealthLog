/**
 * v1.4.15 phase-A3 fix #2 — mood-list mobile card was rendering the score
 * twice: once in the left badge (large bold digit) and once in the title
 * line as "{score} ({label})". On desktop the table view only ever showed
 * one. The fix collapses the title line down to just the localized label
 * (e.g., "Schlecht"), so the row reads
 *
 *     [ 2 ]  Schlecht
 *            12.05.2026, 18:30
 *
 * The Pixel-5 viewport is the only one that mounted the mobile branch
 * (`md:hidden`) so the regression was mobile-only — this spec runs on the
 * `chromium-mobile` project and asserts each `data-testid="mood-row"`
 * contains exactly one occurrence of its score digit.
