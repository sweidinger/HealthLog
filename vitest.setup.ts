/**
 * Unit-test setup.
 *
 * Seed the client-side locale cache with every message bundle. In
 * production only EN ships statically; the active locale arrives as an
 * RSC prop from the root layout and other locales load via dynamic
 * import on switch (see `src/lib/i18n/load-locale.ts`). Tests mount
 * `I18nProvider` standalone — often with `renderToStaticMarkup`, which
 * is synchronous and cannot await a dynamic import — so the cache is
 * primed up front and `t()` resolves every locale on the first render,
 * exactly like the server-handoff path does in the app.
