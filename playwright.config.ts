/**
 * Playwright configuration for the HealthLog E2E suite.
 *
 * The suite covers the smoke-level user paths (auth redirect, login
 * form, public version endpoint, locale switch, axe-core) without
 * needing seeded data — every spec either runs against an unauthed
 * surface or uses route interception to stub out the API. Specs that
 * need a logged-in user are kept narrow and flagged in their describe
 * block; CI runs them against a worker that seeds a deterministic test
 * user on startup.
 *
 * To run locally: `pnpm dlx playwright install --with-deps chromium`
 * once, then `pnpm e2e`.
