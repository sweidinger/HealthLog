/**
 * Emit `docs/api/openapi.yaml` from the registered Zod schemas + route
 * table in `src/lib/openapi/registry.ts`.
 *
 * v1.4.23 baseline: only the iOS-touched routes are registered (see
 * `src/lib/openapi/routes.ts`). The CI step that wraps this script runs
 * with `continue-on-error: true` until the registry catches up with the
 * rest of the hand-maintained `docs/api/openapi.yaml` — once coverage is
 * complete, the gate flips to hard-fail in v1.4.24+.
 *
 * The output is stable across re-runs: `yaml@2` is configured with
 * `sortMapEntries: true` so map keys land in lexicographic order
 * regardless of Node version or the order in which schemas were
 * imported.
