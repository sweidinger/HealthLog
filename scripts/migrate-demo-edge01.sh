# migrate-demo-edge01.sh — copy EXACTLY ONE user (the demo account) from the
# production apps01 Postgres to the SEPARATE edge01 demo Postgres.
#
# ============================================================================
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES (and the isolation guarantees it makes)
# ============================================================================
#
# It transfers a single, demo-scoped slice of health data so the public demo
# instance on edge01 shows a realistic-looking account WITHOUT carrying any
# real-operator data. The ONLY user copied is:
#
#     $DEMO_USER_ID   (the single demo account, supplied via env)
#
# ABSOLUTE INVARIANTS enforced by this script:
#   1. ZERO rows from any other user are transferred. Every source SELECT is
#      scoped to the demo user id (directly via user_id, or join-scoped via a
#      child FK that resolves back to the demo's own parent rows). A PRE-FLIGHT
#      guard counts any row in each carried set whose ownership resolves to a
#      user other than the demo id and ABORTS if the count is non-zero.
#   2. A protected account id ($PROTECT_USER_ID, e.g. the operator's real
#      account) must NEVER appear in any transferred row. A POST-LOAD verification
#      asserts that id is absent from every carried table, and that every
#      user_id-bearing carried table contains ONLY the demo id.
#   3. No secret / credential column is transferred. The users SELECT NULLs
#      every encrypted / token / integration-secret column explicitly. The
#      cycle-day-log SELECT NULLs the two app-encrypted columns (they are
#      keyed to the prod encryption key, which is NOT present on edge01).
#
# The transfer mechanism per table is a scoped server-side COPY piped
# host-to-host:
#
#   ssh "$SRC_SSH" "<psql> -c \"\\copy (SELECT <cols> FROM <t> WHERE <scope>)
#                              TO STDOUT (FORMAT csv, HEADER false)\""
#     | ssh "$DST_SSH" "<psql> -c \"\\copy <t>(<cols>)
#                                  FROM STDIN (FORMAT csv, HEADER false)\""
#
# Explicit column lists are used on BOTH ends so:
#   - secret columns can be omitted / NULLed,
#   - column order is pinned (independent of physical table layout),
#   - an added/dropped column on either side fails loudly rather than
#     silently shifting data into the wrong column.
#
# Tables load in FK-parent-first order. The edge01 demo rows are wiped first
# (FK-child-first), scoped to the edge01 demo user id resolved at runtime.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS FOR REVIEW. Read it, then run it deliberately. It performs
# DESTRUCTIVE deletes on the edge01 demo DB (scoped to the demo user) followed
# by inserts. It NEVER writes to apps01 (source is read-only).
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXCLUDED ENTIRELY (intentionally NOT copied)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   - Auth / session / device surfaces: sessions, passkeys, auth_challenges,
#     api_tokens, refresh_tokens, devices, push_subscriptions, push_attempts,
#     notification_channels, notification_preferences.
#   - Integration / OAuth: withings_connections, whoop_connections,
#     fitbit_connections, all *_oauth_states / *_connect_tickets,
#     telegram_scheduled_deletions, telegram_reminder_messages,
#     clinician_share_links, provider_health.
#   - Encrypted-at-rest payloads we cannot decrypt on edge01:
#     insight_narratives, coach_messages (coach_* entirely).
#   - Coach: coach_conversations, coach_messages, coach_facts, coach_usage.
#   - Ops / transient / regenerable: idempotency_keys, rate_limits,
#     data_backups, import_jobs, host_metrics, feedback,
#     recommendation_feedback, all rollup tables (measurement_rollups,
#     mood_entry_rollups, medication_compliance_rollups, strain_trimp_cache,
#     cycle_predictions) — these REGENERATE on edge01.
#   - workouts / workout_routes / workout_samples — demo has none.
#   - app_settings — instance-level, not user data.
#   - Global catalogues (mood_tags, cycle_symptoms) — pre-exist on edge01;
#     carried link rows reference these GLOBAL ids only (see guards below).
