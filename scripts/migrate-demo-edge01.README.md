# migrate-demo-edge01.sh

Copies **exactly one** user — the demo account
`usr_demo_cf31025295714ece8d91f5af13afd76d` — from the production apps01
Postgres to the **separate** edge01 demo Postgres. No other user's rows are
transferred under any circumstance.

> Review the script first, then run it deliberately. It performs destructive,
> demo-scoped deletes on the edge01 demo DB, then loads the apps01 demo slice.
> It never writes to apps01 (source is read-only).

## How it connects

- **Source (apps01):** SSH alias `apps-01`, container `db-pg8wggwogo8c4gc4ks0kk4ss`
  (stable), psql `healthlog`/`healthlog`.
- **Target (edge01):** SSH alias `edge-01`. The demo Postgres is a separate
  Coolify resource whose container name is **not hardcoded** — the script
  resolves it at runtime via `docker ps | grep -iE 'postgres|^db-'` and aborts
  if it cannot pick a single match (override with `DST_DB_CONTAINER=db-xxxx`).
  The demo **app** uuid is `ck8cs4osswg8w440gskw08w8`; match its linked
  Postgres resource, not the docs/landing DB.
- **Edge demo user id is resolved at runtime** by `username='demo'` (it may
  differ from the apps01 id). The wipe phase is scoped to that resolved id; the
  load then brings the apps01 row in, so afterwards the edge01 demo user
  carries the apps01 canonical id.

Each table is transferred with a scoped, server-side `\copy ... TO STDOUT`
piped host-to-host into `\copy ... FROM STDIN`, using **explicit column lists
on both ends** so secret columns can be NULLed and column order is pinned.

## Secret / credential columns NULLed on the `users` row

`codex_access_token_encrypted`, `codex_refresh_token_encrypted`,
`codex_token_expires_at`, `codex_connected_at` (and `codex_connection_status`
reset to `'disconnected'`), `ai_anthropic_key_encrypted`,
`ai_local_key_encrypted`, `ai_openai_key_encrypted`,
`withings_client_id_encrypted`, `withings_client_secret_encrypted`,
`whoop_client_id_encrypted`, `whoop_client_secret_encrypted`,
`fitbit_client_id_encrypted`, `fitbit_client_secret_encrypted`,
`telegram_bot_token`, `telegram_chat_id`, `mood_log_url_encrypted`,
`mood_log_api_key_encrypted`, `mood_log_webhook_secret`,
`insurance_number_encrypted`, `insurer_name`, `insurer_ik_number`.

Forced flags: `telegram_enabled=false`, `mood_log_enabled=false`,
`role='ADMIN'`.

**Kept:** `password_hash` (demo login works), `avatar_bytes` /
`avatar_content_type` / `avatar_updated_at` (profile photo), and all
display / preference / layout JSON (`thresholds_json`,
`dashboard_widgets_json`, `insights_layout_json`, `coach_prefs_json`,
`source_priority_json`, `doctor_report_prefs_json`, `notification_prefs`,
`healthkit_config_json`, unit prefs, `height_cm`, `gender`, `timezone`,
`locale`, `date_of_birth`, `display_name`, onboarding state, research-mode
acknowledgement).

## What is excluded — and why

- **Auth / device / push** (sessions, passkeys, auth_challenges, api_tokens,
  refresh_tokens, devices, push_subscriptions, push_attempts,
  notification_channels, notification_preferences) — per-environment, never
  portable.
- **Integration / OAuth** (withings/whoop/fitbit connections, all
  `*_oauth_states` / `*_connect_tickets`, telegram scheduled-deletions +
  reminder messages, clinician_share_links, provider_health) — tied to live
  credentials.
- **Encrypted-at-rest payloads we can't decrypt on edge01:**
  `insight_narratives` and all `coach_*` (coach_conversations, coach_messages,
  coach_facts, coach_usage). The edge01 instance does not hold the prod
  encryption key, so the AES-256-GCM ciphertext would be unreadable. The same
  reason drives NULLing `cycle_day_logs.sensitive_encrypted` /
  `notes_encrypted` while still carrying that table's plaintext cycle fields.
  The plaintext AI assessment text is preserved through the `insights.%`
  `audit_logs` rows (the text lives in the `details` JSON) instead.
- **Transient / regenerable:** idempotency_keys, rate_limits, data_backups,
  import_jobs, host_metrics, feedback, recommendation_feedback, and all rollup
  tables (measurement_rollups, mood_entry_rollups,
  medication_compliance_rollups, strain_trimp_cache, cycle_predictions) — these
  rebuild on edge01.
- **No rows:** workouts / workout_routes / workout_samples (demo has none).
- **Instance / global:** app_settings; global catalogues (mood_tags,
  cycle_symptoms) — these pre-exist on edge01 and the carried link rows
  reference the global ids only.

## Encryption note

The edge01 demo instance is assumed **not** to share the apps01 encryption
key. Every column whose value is AES-256-GCM ciphertext under the prod key is
either NULLed (secrets on `users`, `cycle_day_logs.*_encrypted`) or skipped
entirely (`insight_narratives`, `coach_messages.encryptedContent`). Carrying
that ciphertext would produce undecryptable rows that the app's fail-closed
loader would reject.

## role = ADMIN + DEMO_MODE expectations

The demo user is loaded with `role='ADMIN'` so the admin surfaces are
viewable in the demo. This is **only safe because DEMO_MODE must stay ON** on
edge01 — the proxy layer (`src/proxy.ts`) blocks every mutating request in
demo mode, so an admin demo session can browse admin pages but cannot change
anything. If DEMO_MODE were ever off on edge01, this admin demo account would
be a write-capable admin. Keep DEMO_MODE enabled.

## Safety mechanisms built into the script

- `set -euo pipefail` and `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` on every psql call.
- **Pre-flight guard (apps01):** for each carried set, a query that must
  return `0` foreign-owned rows — aborts on any non-zero. Includes a check
  that the demo owns **0 custom mood_tags** (so every carried
  `mood_entry_tag_link` points at a global tag that pre-exists on edge01) plus
  a defensive "non-global tag" link count.
- **Scoped wipe-first (edge01):** FK-child-first deletes, every one scoped to
  the runtime-resolved edge01 demo id. No unscoped delete anywhere. Refuses to
  proceed if `username='demo'` on edge01 resolves to the operator id.
- **Post-load verification (edge01):** per-table demo row counts; a hard
  assertion that the operator id `cmlupy4tn000001rpzx1pxvz7` appears in zero
  rows; a check that user_id-bearing carried tables hold only the demo id; and
  a confirmation the demo user exists with `role=ADMIN`.

## Caveats / things to confirm before running

- **`FOREIGN_HITS` assertion** counts _all_ non-demo rows in the carried
  tables on edge01, not just what this run inserted. On a clean
  single-demo-user DB it is `0`. If edge01 legitimately hosts other demo-only
  accounts, treat a non-zero value as a warning to inspect, not an automatic
  failure (the script prints it as a WARNING, not an abort).
- Confirm edge01 psql credentials are `healthlog`/`healthlog` (the script
  verifies connectivity before any write; adjust `PG_USER` / `PG_DB` if the
  demo Postgres resource uses different ones).
- The script assumes edge01's schema is at the same (or a compatible) Prisma
  migration level as apps01. A column present on apps01 but missing on edge01
  fails the `\copy` loudly rather than silently corrupting data — run
  migrations on edge01 first if the two have drifted.
