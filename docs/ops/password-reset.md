# Password reset (operator)

A self-hosted operator can reset a single user's password from inside the
running container. This is an **operator-only** maintenance path — there is no
user-facing or API route for it, and it bypasses the normal account-recovery
flow. Use it only for an account you administer (for example, after a forgotten
password on a single-user instance).

> **Operator-only.** The script writes directly to the `users` table and is
> intended to be run by the host operator with database access. Treat the new
> password like any other secret: pass it on stdin (it is read without echoing)
> rather than as a shell argument where it would land in shell history and the
> process list.

## Run it

The reset CLI ships in the image and runs under plain `node` against the built
runtime (the standalone image strips `tsx`, so this is a `.mjs` that uses the
in-image `pg` and `@node-rs/argon2` directly and reuses the app's exact Argon2id
parameters):

```sh
docker compose exec app node scripts/reset-password.mjs <username-or-email>
```

The script prompts for the new password without echoing it, then prints a
confirmation that names only the user — never the password:

```
New password (input hidden):
reset-password: password updated for "alice"
```

You can also pass the password as a second argument for non-interactive use,
but prefer the stdin prompt so the secret stays out of shell history:

```sh
docker compose exec app node scripts/reset-password.mjs alice 'a-strong-passphrase'
```

## Behaviour

- The identifier is matched **case-insensitively** against `username` **or**
  `email`, mirroring the login lookup.
- The match must resolve to exactly one user. Zero matches exits non-zero with
  `no user matches "<id>"`; multiple matches exits non-zero and refuses to guess.
- The new password must be at least 12 characters (the app's minimum).
- The password is hashed with Argon2id using the same cost parameters as the
  application (`src/lib/auth/argon2-params.mjs`), so the stored hash is
  identical to one the app would mint.
- `DATABASE_URL` is read from the environment — the same variable the app uses,
  honouring any `sslmode=` in the connection string.

## Source checkout

From a source checkout (not the production image) the same script runs under
Node directly:

```sh
DATABASE_URL='postgres://…' node scripts/reset-password.mjs <username-or-email>
```
