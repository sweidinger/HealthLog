# Apple Health → cycle mapping

How HealthLog folds Apple Health reproductive samples into the cycle model.
Both the `export.xml` importer and the iOS batch contract share one mapping
table: `src/lib/cycle/healthkit-mapping.ts`. This page is the human-readable
companion — keep the two in sync.

Reproductive samples route into **cycle day-logs** (`CycleDayLog`), never into
`Measurement`. Each Apple Health day collapses into one canonical day-log per
`(user, date)`; the importer writes `source = APPLE_HEALTH` with a synthetic
per-day `externalId` (`hkcycle:<YYYY-MM-DD>`) so a re-import upserts the same
row. The fold only runs when cycle tracking is enabled for the account.

## Day-log fields

| HealthKit category type | CycleDayLog field | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `MenstrualFlow` | `flow` | unspecified→LIGHT, light→LIGHT, medium→MEDIUM, heavy→HEAVY, none→NONE |
| `IntermenstrualBleeding` | `intermenstrualBleeding` | presence → `true` |
| `CervicalMucusQuality` | `cervicalMucus` | dry→DRY, sticky→STICKY, creamy→CREAMY, watery→WATERY, eggWhite→EGG_WHITE |
| `OvulationTestResult` | `ovulationTest` | negative→NEGATIVE, lhSurge→POSITIVE_LH_SURGE, indeterminate→INDETERMINATE, estrogenSurge→ESTROGEN_SURGE |
| `SexualActivity` | `sexualActivity` + `protectedSex` | presence → `true`; `HKMetadataKeySexualActivityProtectionUsed` → `protectedSex` |
| `PregnancyTestResult` | `pregnancyTest` | negative→NEGATIVE, positive→POSITIVE, indeterminate→INDETERMINATE |
| `ProgesteroneTestResult` | `progesteroneTest` | negative→NEGATIVE, positive→POSITIVE, indeterminate→INDETERMINATE |
| `Contraceptive` | `contraceptive` (+ profile nudge) | unspecified→UNSPECIFIED, implant→IMPLANT, injection→INJECTION, iud→IUD, ring→INTRAVAGINAL_RING, oral→ORAL, patch→PATCH, emergency→EMERGENCY |

HealthLog's `SPOTTING` flow level has no HealthKit counterpart; it is only ever
produced by a manual entry. HealthKit `unspecified` flow maps to `LIGHT` (a
logged-but-unspecified bleeding day is at least light flow).

## Symptom category types → seeded symptom keys

Symptom category samples link to the seeded `CycleSymptom` catalogue by key. A
sample whose severity is *not present* (codepoint 1) does NOT create a link.

| HealthKit category type | CycleSymptom key |
|---|---|
| `AbdominalCramps` | `cramps` |
| `Headache` | `headache` |
| `Bloating` | `bloating` |
| `Acne` | `acne` |
| `BreastPain` | `breast_tenderness` |
| `Fatigue` | `fatigue` |
| `LowerBackPain` | `back_pain` |
| `SleepChanges` | `insomnia` |
| `MoodChanges` | `mood_swings` |
| `AppetiteChanges` | `food_cravings` |
| `Nausea` | `nausea` |

## Profile-level signals

A `Contraceptive` sample asserting an active method also nudges the
`CycleProfile.goal` to `AVOID_PREGNANCY` — but only when the goal is still on
its `GENERAL_HEALTH` default, so an explicit user choice is never overwritten.

## Basal body temperature

`basalBodyTemperature` is **not** routed here. It stays a
`Measurement(BODY_TEMPERATURE)` (the system of record for the rollup tier and
the cross-source source-priority ladder) and is mirrored onto
`CycleDayLog.basalBodyTempC` for the cycle chart. Apple Watch wrist/skin
temperature already flows to `WRIST_TEMPERATURE` / `SKIN_TEMPERATURE` and feeds
the temperature-trend ovulation method directly from `Measurement`.

## Deferred

| HealthKit category type | Status |
|---|---|
| `Pregnancy`, `Lactation` | Deferred — no `CycleProfile` column yet (pregnancy-mode is a later release). |
| `BleedingDuringPregnancy`, `BleedingAfterPregnancy` | Deferred — pregnancy-mode. |
| `IrregularMenstrualCycles`, `InfrequentMenstrualCycles`, `ProlongedMenstrualPeriods`, `PersistentIntermenstrualBleeding` | Server-derived from the cycle engine, never ingested. |
