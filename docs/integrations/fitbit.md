# Fitbit integration (Fitbit & Pixel)

> **Experimental.** Field mapping is still being verified against live accounts,
> so some values may be missing or change in a future update.

HealthLog reads Fitbit and Pixel Watch data through the **classic Fitbit Web
API** (`api.fitbit.com`). The OAuth app is a **Fitbit developer app registered
at [dev.fitbit.com](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new)** — **not** a Google Cloud
OAuth client. Like WHOOP, credentials are brought per user: each user (or the
operator on their behalf) registers their own Fitbit app and pastes the client
id/secret into Settings. The internal integration key is `fitbit`.

> **Common mistake:** the field wants a **Fitbit** Client ID (a short numeric
> id from dev.fitbit.com), **not** a Google Cloud client id ending in
> `.apps.googleusercontent.com`. A Google Cloud client fails at the Fitbit
> consent screen with `unauthorized_client — Invalid client_id`, because Fitbit
> and Google Cloud are separate client registries.

> **Heads-up — September 2026 sunset.** Google is retiring the classic Fitbit
> Web API in **September 2026** and moving to the Google Health API behind Google
> sign-in. That replacement currently requires Google Restricted-scope brand
> verification plus an annual third-party CASA security assessment, which does
> not fit a self-hosted bring-your-own-credentials model, so the path beyond the
> sunset is still being worked out. Until then the setup below is the supported
> way to connect Fitbit.

## 1. Register a Fitbit developer app

1. Sign in at <https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new> and register a new application.
2. **OAuth 2.0 Application Type:**
   - **Personal** — the app only ever sees the **owner's own** Fitbit account,
     and gets intraday (per-minute) heart-rate/steps automatically. This is the
     right choice for a single-person self-host.
   - **Server** (or **Client**) — needed when the instance connects **other
     people's** accounts. Intraday/heart-rate access is then granted case by
     case via Fitbit's Intraday Data Access request form.
3. **Callback URL:** `https://your-instance.example.com/api/fitbit/callback`
   — absolute, **HTTPS**, and matching the `redirect_uri` HealthLog sends (see
   the redirect-URI note below). One entry per environment you connect from.
4. **Scopes:** tick the ones HealthLog requests (next section).
5. Save. Fitbit issues a **Client ID** (short, numeric) and a **Client Secret**
   — keep the secret out of any chat log.

## 2. Scopes

HealthLog requests exactly these read scopes (space-separated on the wire):

```
activity cardio_fitness heartrate oxygen_saturation profile respiratory_rate sleep weight
```

The `temperature` scope is intentionally omitted — the classic skin-temperature
reading is a baseline delta rather than an absolute value, so it has no honest
canonical slot yet. The authorization uses the Authorization Code Grant **with
PKCE (S256)**, which Fitbit recommends; HealthLog mints the `code_verifier`
server-side and never exposes it to the browser.

## 3. Wire the credentials in Settings → Integrations

Credentials are stored per user, not in `.env`. Sign in as the target user, open
**Settings → Integrations → Fitbit**, and paste the Client ID and Client Secret.
They are encrypted AES-256-GCM at rest.

## 4. Connect

Click **Connect with Fitbit**. HealthLog redirects to the Fitbit consent screen
(`www.fitbit.com/oauth2/authorize`), exchanges the returned code for an access +
refresh token at `api.fitbit.com/oauth2/token`, stores them encrypted, and runs
an initial sync. There is **no webhook** — Fitbit syncs on the safety-net cron
pull. Classic Fitbit refresh tokens rotate (one-time use); HealthLog replaces the
stored token on every refresh.

## Redirect URI is validated strictly

The resolved `redirect_uri` is asserted at connect time to be absolute, `https`
(or `http` on localhost), to target exactly `/api/fitbit/callback`, and — when
`FITBIT_REDIRECT_URI` is set alongside `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — to share its
origin. A misconfigured value fails closed rather than redirecting elsewhere.

## Optional instance env var

```env
# Only when the callback origin differs from NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL:
FITBIT_REDIRECT_URI="https://your-instance.example.com/api/fitbit/callback"
```

The Fitbit client id/secret are per-user (Settings), not env vars.

## Source overlap

If Fitbit and another source (Withings, WHOOP, Apple Health) both supply the same
vital — resting heart rate, blood oxygen, body temperature or respiratory rate —
you may see both values until a future update settles on a single preferred
source.

## Disconnect

The Settings **Disconnect** button revokes the stored tokens and removes the
connection. Previously synced measurements stay in the database.
