# Reproductive-health data on your own server

HealthLog's cycle tracking stores menstrual, fertility, and related
reproductive-health data the same way it stores every other metric: in
the PostgreSQL database that runs on the host you control, encrypted at
rest for the intent-revealing fields. This page explains what that
arrangement does and does not change about who can reach that data, in
plain terms and without overstating the protection.

## What self-hosting changes

A consumer cycle-tracking app runs on the vendor's servers. Your
reproductive-health data lives in their database, under their keys, in
their jurisdiction. If that vendor receives a subpoena, a civil
discovery request, or a law-enforcement demand it judges valid, the
vendor — not you — decides how to respond, and it holds the data and the
keys needed to comply. Several vendors state in their own privacy
policies that they comply with valid legal process; that is a factual
description of where the data sits, not an accusation.

Self-hosting removes that vendor from the picture. There is no cloud
account holding your cycle data, no vendor key escrow, and no third
party that can be served process to hand over data it does not have. The
honest framing is narrow and worth stating precisely:

> Self-hosting means there is no cloud vendor to subpoena for your
> reproductive-health data. It does **not** make the data
> unreachable.

The encryption-at-rest layer is real: the intent-revealing day-log
fields (free-text notes always; pregnancy, contraception, and
sexual-activity fields by default for this category) are encrypted with
AES-256-GCM under a key you supply via `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`, and the
application fails closed rather than ever writing those fields in
plaintext. Flow, basal body temperature, ovulation-test results,
cervical-mucus observations, and the cycle dates stay in plaintext
because the prediction and correlation engines read them; they are
health observations, not the disclosure-sensitive intent fields.

## The residual threat (read this part)

Self-hosting moves the data onto a box you own. That box can still be
reached:

- **Physical or legal seizure of your own host.** If the machine
  running PostgreSQL — your VPS, your home server, your NAS — is seized,
  imaged, or compelled, the data is on it. Encryption at rest protects
  against a stolen disk or a leaked backup only while the key is *not*
  also available; if the host is running, or the key is stored next to
  the data, that protection is gone.
- **Your hosting provider.** A VPS provider can snapshot your disk and
  can be served process the same way a SaaS vendor can. Self-hosting on
  rented infrastructure narrows the set of parties who hold your data;
  it does not reduce it to zero.
- **Your own backups.** Off-host backups (the optional S3 export, or any
  `pg_dump` you take) carry the same data. Encrypt them, control where
  they land, and treat them as part of the same threat surface.
- **The device that talks to the server.** A phone or laptop with a
  live session, a cached PWA, or the native client holds data locally
  too. Protecting the server does nothing for an unlocked device.

The promise is therefore specific: **no cloud vendor to subpoena**, not
**data nobody can ever reach**. If your threat model includes seizure of
your own infrastructure, encryption at rest plus a key you keep off the
host is the floor, and the threat-model note below covers the rest.

## Public record

The reason this distinction matters is documented in public legal
record, not speculation:

- In 2021 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission settled with the maker of a
  period- and fertility-tracking app over allegations that it shared
  users' health data with third-party analytics and advertising
  services despite privacy promises. The settlement is public record.
- In 2025 a federal jury found that the same app's maker violated a
  California privacy statute over the sharing of menstrual-tracking
  data; the verdict and the underlying class action are public record.

These are cited as factual public record to explain *why* the
"who holds the data" question is the one that matters for this category.
HealthLog makes no claim about any other product's current practices.

## Practical hardening

If reproductive-health privacy is the reason you self-host, the
operator-side steps that matter most:

- Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` off the host that runs PostgreSQL where your
  threat model allows it (an injected secret at boot, not a file next to
  the database). See `docs/ops/encryption-key-rotation.md`.
- Turn off any integration you do not need. The fewer outbound paths,
  the smaller the surface.
- Encrypt and control your backups. The off-host backup feature uses
  AES-GCM; the destination bucket and its access are yours to lock down.
- Use the in-app **discreet notifications** toggle so cycle reminders
  never name the event on a lock screen, and the **client-managed
  reminders** path if you want the device, not the server, to own those
  notifications.
- Lock the devices that hold a live session.
