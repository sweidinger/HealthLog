# MCP connector — enable and connect

HealthLog can expose **one user's own health record to an external
assistant** (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Claude Desktop) through a Model Context
Protocol (MCP) server. The assistant reads your figures — vitals, sleep,
labs, medications, discovered drivers — and, if you opt in, can log a
self-reported reading back. Everything stays on your instance; the
assistant only sees what it asks for, one record at a time.

The surface is **off by default**. It does nothing until you (1) pin a
canonical origin, (2) turn the `mcp` module on for your account, and
(3) mint a token. A self-hoster who never opts in gets zero new exposure
— the `/mcp` endpoint answers `404` until all three are in place.

This guide covers turning it on and pointing a real client at it. For
what the server can do, see [the capabilities
reference](../api/mcp-capabilities.md); for building a connector or skill
on top of it, see [building skills](../api/mcp-skills.md).

## Prerequisites

Three things must be true before `/mcp` will answer:

| Requirement                | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`APP_URL` is set**       | The endpoint fails closed without a pinned canonical origin. `APP_URL` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`) is the origin every OAuth document and audience check is anchored to — `Host` is never trusted. Without it the surface stays invisible (`404`). |
| **The global API is on**   | The operator's instance-wide API switch must be enabled (it is by default). With it off, every token path — including `/mcp` — returns `404`.                                                                                                     |
| **The `mcp` module is on** | A per-account opt-in. It is the only module that ships dark; you turn it on in Settings. Until then `/mcp` answers `404` for that account.                                                                                                        |

`APP_URL` is the same origin you already use for passkeys and invite
links — for example `https://health.example`. It must be reachable by the
client you are connecting (Claude.ai and ChatGPT connect from their own
servers, so the origin has to be a real public hostname for those; a
LAN-only origin works for Claude Desktop over stdio).

## 1. Enable the module

In the app: **Settings → MCP**. The card has three parts:

- **Enable** — the opt-in switch. Toggle it on; the `/mcp` endpoint goes
  live for your account and the card shows your endpoint URL
  (`<origin>/mcp`).
- **Connections** — cloud connectors that completed the OAuth flow appear
  here; revoke any of them.
- **Tokens** — manual connector tokens (see below).

## 2. Mint a connector token

Still in **Settings → MCP → Tokens**:

1. Choose the scope with the **write** toggle:
   - **off** → a read-only token (`health:read`). This is the default and
     the right choice unless you actually want the assistant to log
     readings.
   - **on** → a read **and** write token (`health:read health:write`).
     The write scope only ever admits the three confirmed, append-only
     write tools (below) and is **bound to `/mcp`** — it can never write
     over the regular REST API.
2. Name the token and create it.
3. **Copy the `hlk_…` value now** — it is shown exactly once and cannot
   be retrieved again. Tokens default to a 90-day lifetime.

The token never carries the `*` wildcard and never a medication-ingest
scope — it is the least-privilege MCP scope and nothing more, and it is
bound to the MCP surface: it is refused on every REST route. The same
list shows last-used time and lets you revoke any token.

Cloud connectors that use OAuth (next section) mint the same
`health:read` scope automatically, so for Claude.ai / ChatGPT you do not
need to mint a token by hand — the manual token is for the stdio / power-
user path and for clients you wire up with a static Bearer.

## 3. Connect a client

The endpoint is `<APP_URL>/mcp` for every remote client. A non-browser
client (Claude.ai / ChatGPT server-side) sends no `Origin`, so it
connects directly; a browser `Origin` that does not match `APP_URL` is
refused (`403`) as a DNS-rebinding defence.

### Claude.ai (remote + OAuth)

1. In Claude.ai, add a custom connector and paste `<APP_URL>/mcp`.
2. Claude.ai discovers the OAuth flow automatically: the `401` from
   `/mcp` points at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, which names
   the authorization server, and the client walks `/authorize` →
   `/token`. PKCE (S256) is mandatory; the built-in bridge accepts
   client-id-metadata-document clients with dynamic registration as a
   fallback.
3. Approve the consent screen. The connection then appears under
   **Settings → MCP → Connections**, where you can revoke it.

No token to paste — OAuth mints and rotates a short-lived `health:read`
access token (60 minutes, with a refresh token) behind the scenes.

### ChatGPT (remote)

1. Add `<APP_URL>/mcp` as a connector. The same OAuth discovery applies.
2. In ChatGPT's **default** (non-Developer) mode, the only tools it will
   call are **`search`** and **`fetch`** — these are HealthLog's two-tool
   retrieval façade over the same server-authoritative reads. So in
   default ChatGPT you ask in natural language ("what's my recent LDL?")
   and it searches your record and fetches the matching item with a
   citation deep-link back into the app. Developer mode exposes the full
   tool catalogue.

### Claude Desktop (stdio)

Claude Desktop runs a local process and speaks the protocol over stdio —
no OAuth, no public hostname. Mint a token (step 2), then add an entry to
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthlog": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": ["dlx", "tsx", "src/cli/mcp-stdio.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/HealthLog",
      "env": {
        "HEALTHLOG_MCP_TOKEN": "hlk_…",
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://…",
        "API_TOKEN_HMAC_KEY": "…",
        "ENCRYPTION_KEYS": "…"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stdio entrypoint reads the token from `HEALTHLOG_MCP_TOKEN`
(preferred — keeps the secret out of the process argument list) or as the
first CLI argument. With no token it refuses to start; running it with a
minted token **is** the opt-in. It needs database access, so it runs from
a checkout with the same `DATABASE_URL` / `API_TOKEN_HMAC_KEY` /
`ENCRYPTION_KEYS` your instance uses. Use `tsx` via `pnpm dlx` — the
production standalone image strips `tsx`, so this is a local-only tool.
stdout is the JSON-RPC channel; diagnostics go to stderr.

## Trust model — read this before enabling writes

The combination of a **remote** endpoint, **write** capability, and
**OAuth** access is exactly the high-leverage surface to be careful with.
HealthLog ships several structural limits, but the operator's choices
still matter:

- **Only enable the connector for clients you trust.** Anything that
  holds a valid token or a live OAuth connection reads your health
  record. Revoke connections and tokens you no longer use (Settings →
  MCP).
- **Use a read-only token unless you need writes.** The default. A
  read-only session never even sees the write tools advertised.
- **Writes are narrow by construction.** The only writes are
  append-only, confirmed inserts of a single self-reported reading
  (`log_measurement`, `log_mood`, `log_blood_pressure`). There is no
  medication, lab, schedule, delete, update, or data-export tool, and a
  `health:write` MCP token is refused on every REST write — it can never
  become a general write credential.
- **Admin is unreachable over MCP.** `requireAdmin()` is cookie-only and
  the MCP wire carries no cookie, so no token — not even a `*` wildcard —
  can reach an admin endpoint over this surface.

The structural guarantees are detailed in [the capabilities
reference](../api/mcp-capabilities.md#security-and-write-model).
