# HealthLog on Unraid

HealthLog runs on Unraid in two ways. The **Compose Manager** path is the clean,
self-contained install (app + database as one unit) and is recommended. The
**Community Applications (CA)** template gives you the familiar one-app-at-a-time
Unraid UI, but because CA templates describe a single container you install
PostgreSQL separately and wire the two together.

HealthLog stores all persistent state in PostgreSQL — the app container itself is
stateless (the offline geo-IP databases are baked into the image). A backup of
the database is a backup of everything.

## What you need

- Unraid 6.12 or newer.
- The image: `ghcr.io/mbombeck/healthlog:latest` (multi-arch, amd64 + arm64).
- Three secrets, each generated with `openssl rand -hex 32` (a 64-character hex
  string). On Unraid open the terminal (the `>_` icon, top-right) and run the
  command three times:
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — the database password
  - `ENCRYPTION_KEY` — AES-256-GCM key for data at rest
  - `API_TOKEN_HMAC_KEY` — API token hashing key

Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEY` safe and backed up. If you lose it, the encrypted columns
become unrecoverable.

## Recommended: Compose Manager

This installs the app and its database together, exactly as the project's
`docker-compose.yml` describes.

1. Install **Compose Manager** from Community Applications (search "Compose
   Manager", by dcflachs).
2. **Settings → Docker → Compose Manager → Add New Stack**, name it `healthlog`.
3. Paste the project
   [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/MBombeck/HealthLog/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
   into the stack's compose file.
4. Edit the stack's `.env` (the "Edit Stack → env" field) and set:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your openssl rand -hex 32>
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your openssl rand -hex 32>
   API_TOKEN_HMAC_KEY=<your openssl rand -hex 32>
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://tower:3000
   APP_URL=http://tower:3000
   ```

   Replace `tower` with your server's hostname or IP. `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false`
   is required for plain-HTTP LAN access — see the note below.

5. **Compose Up**. The app waits for PostgreSQL, runs database migrations on
   first boot, then starts serving.
6. Open `http://tower:3000`. The first account you register becomes the admin.

Verify the running version:

```bash
curl -s http://tower:3000/api/version
```

## Alternative: Community Applications template

Use this if you prefer the per-app Unraid UI. You install PostgreSQL yourself,
then add HealthLog pointed at it.

### Step 1 — install PostgreSQL 16

1. In **Apps** (Community Applications), search for a **PostgreSQL** container
   (for example jj9987's `postgresql`). Install version 16.
2. Set:
   - `POSTGRES_USER` = `healthlog`
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` = your generated password
   - `POSTGRES_DB` = `healthlog`
3. Map the Postgres data path to a share on the array (e.g.
   `/mnt/user/appdata/healthlog-db`) so the database survives container updates.
4. Note the container's IP (or container name if both run on the same custom
   Docker network).

### Step 2 — add the HealthLog template

The template lives at
[`docs/self-hosting/unraid/healthlog.xml`](unraid/healthlog.xml). Add it via
**Docker → Add Container → Template** and paste the raw URL, or copy it into
`/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` and pick it from the template
dropdown.

Fill in the fields:

| Field                   | Value                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WebUI Port              | `3000`                                                                           |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | `postgresql://healthlog:<password>@<postgres-host>:5432/healthlog?schema=public` |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`        | your generated key                                                               |
| `API_TOKEN_HMAC_KEY`    | your generated key                                                               |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` for plain-HTTP LAN access                                                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`   | `http://tower:3000` (or your domain)                                             |
| `APP_URL`               | same as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`                                                    |

Replace `<password>` and `<postgres-host>` with the values from Step 1. Apply,
then open `http://tower:3000` — the first registered user becomes the admin.

The HealthLog container has no persistent volume of its own; all state is in the
PostgreSQL container you installed in Step 1. Back that one up.

## The one setting that trips people up

`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` is required for plain-HTTP LAN installs
(`http://tower:3000`). Left at its default, the session cookie carries the
`Secure` flag, the browser refuses to send it over HTTP, and login appears to
"do nothing" — the page reloads to the login screen with no error.

Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (or leave it unset) only when a TLS reverse
proxy serves HealthLog over HTTPS. In that case also point `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
and `APP_URL` at the public `https://` URL.

## Updates

Pin a release tag (`ghcr.io/mbombeck/healthlog:vX.Y.Z`) and bump deliberately,
or track `:latest` and let Unraid's update check re-pull. Skim the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/MBombeck/HealthLog/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) before
upgrading, and back up the database first. Migrations are forward-only and run
automatically on container start.

## Health check

Both `/api/health` and `/api/version` respond without authentication.
`/api/health` returns `200` when the database and background worker are up
(`503` otherwise) and is the container health probe baked into the image.
`/api/version` returns the version, build SHA, and build timestamp for deploy
verification.
