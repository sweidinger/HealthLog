/**
 * v1.20.0 F6 — bit-identical parity for the rollup regression accumulators.
 *
 * The windowed slope / r² / population-sd now compose from the per-bucket
 * accumulators (`sum_x / sum_xy / sum_xx / sum_yy`, plus `n = count` and
 * `Σy = mean·count`) that migration 0190 added to `measurement_rollups`.
 * Because the accumulators are additive and Postgres `REGR_SLOPE` /
 * `REGR_R2` / `STDDEV_POP` fold the SAME closed form over the SAME epoch-day
 * x-axis the populator stored, the cross-bucket compose must equal the live
 * aggregate over the raw rows EXACTLY — not within a tolerance.
 *
 * This suite seeds raw measurements spanning many DAY buckets with uneven
 * per-day counts (the regime where mean-of-means and the true regression
 * diverge), folds the rollups, then asserts:
 *
 *   1. `composeRegression` over the folded DAY-bucket accumulators equals
 *      `REGR_SLOPE` / `REGR_R2` / `STDDEV_POP` over the raw rows to a tight
 *      relative tolerance.
 *
 * Tolerance note: both paths fold the SAME closed form over the SAME raw-row
 * epoch-day x set, so they agree mathematically. They disagree only in float
 * summation order — Postgres's parallel aggregate accumulators vs. the
 * textbook `n·Σxy − Σx·Σy` closed form `composeRegression` evaluates from the
 * stored sums. With a UTC epoch-day x-axis (x ≈ 20 540), `n·Σxx − Σx²` is a
 * difference of two ~1e10 magnitudes, so the closed form sheds ~10 significant
 * digits to cancellation before the divide. That makes an ABSOLUTE 9-dp
 * `toBeCloseTo` the wrong gauge for a slope this small — the residual is float
 * reorder noise, not a data divergence. Parity is asserted RELATIVELY at
 * 1e-9, which is far tighter than the 2–3 dp the read tier ultimately rounds
 * the windowed slope / r² / sd to.
 *   2. The source-collapse runs BEFORE accumulator summation — a dual-source
 *      day contributes only the canonical source's accumulators, matching a
 *      live regression over the canonical-source rows.
 *   3. A DST-boundary reading lands in the same epoch-day x the live query
 *      uses (the x-axis is UTC `EXTRACT(EPOCH …)/86400`, DST-agnostic).
